        "Engineers face a time of extraordinary opportunity—and significant need—with regard to infrastructure. According to the most recent report card issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, more than a third of the 600,000 bridges in the United States are more than 50 years old. About 32 percent of urban roads and 14 percent of rural roads are in poor condition. Our network of water pipes is aging.",
