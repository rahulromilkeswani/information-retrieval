        "UIC Engineering’s mission is access to excellence and success. We educate students to innovate and to lead. We expand global knowledge of the engineering field through excellence in original research. In addition, as a public institution we prioritize our relationship with the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois. We foster strong local partnerships, provide crucial engineering expertise and facilities, and serve as a major economic driver for the region.",
        "Our current priorities include:",
        "Extraordinary value",
        "The total cost for a UIC undergraduate engineering education is about $60,000—a third the price of the same degree at many private universities.",
        "Extraordinary dividends",
        "The number of UIC Engineering bachelor of science graduates reporting starting salaries between $70,000 and more than $100,000 nearly doubled since last year.",
        "Extraordinary location",
        "Our students benefit from the full range of internships, job opportunities, startup incubators, and other resources of metropolitan Chicago.",
        "Guaranteed internships",
        "UIC Engineering is home to a unique Guaranteed Paid Internship Program that places qualified first-year and transfer students in compensated summer internships in one of 42 UIC research laboratories.",
        "World-changing research",
        "Supported by more than $94 million in grants, our faculty are working on research that stands to help clean our air, provide access to water, revolutionize battery technology, improve healthcare, sharpen data security, and address hundreds of other issues.",
        "Accomplished faculty",
        "Our 195 faculty include 43 recipients of the prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER Award. They hold 89 fellowships in professional societies and have received more than 75 teaching awards from UIC and other institutions."
