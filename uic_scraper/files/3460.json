        "The Department Head oversees the research and teaching missions of the Department, doing fundraising and long-term planning as well as directing financial management and student services day to day. An open-door policy encourages graduate students to drop in with any questions or issues about the general climate for learning or the support of research in the Department or at UIC.",
        "The Director of Graduate Studies is the chief advisor and first point of contact for students entering graduate study in the Department, as well as the final gatekeeper at the completion of graduate study. Assessment of individual graduate students, courses, and overall programs comes under the Director of Graduate Studies, who manages admissions as chair of the Graduate Program Committee and leads other aspects of graduate academics as an ex-officio member of the IRB and Colloquium Committees.",
        "To declare communication as either a major or a minor, students should declare in the LAS Social Sciences Advising located in 809 UH (phone: 312-355-5133).",
        "Upon meeting and maintaining these performance standards and declaring the major, students should schedule an appointment with Erica Mann for internship, career, or graduate school advice.",
        "The department Business Manager/Administrative Associate handles all aspects of graduate student appointments to assistantships, payroll, grant administration, and related matters.",
        "The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences IT department manages the department facilities and provides technical support for issues related to instruction in the Department. (Issues related to research are the purview of the Administrative Secretary.)",
        "Additionally, please use this form to report any IT/Media related issues and also for technology related consulting. Please describe the problem in detail and also fill out additional information if applicable. We will respond to the request as early as possible."
