        "The Library offers many services to distance education users and online students who connect to UIC remotely.",
        "Currently enrolled students have the same access to online full-text articles as you would on campus. The only login you need is an active NetID and password. (The Library account is only for physical books and other material.)",
        "Access databases and search for articles through the library website—even Google Scholar and PubMed.",
        "The links on our website have special URLs that will recognize you as a UIC user when you are off campus. This allows you to access more full text resources than if you tried to find them through the open web.",
        "The VPN allows you to securely access resources at UIC over a non-UIC Internet connection. It is not required to access UIC resources from off-campus but may help if you are experiencing problems. Note that there is a separate VPN group for accessing Library Resources.",
        "UIC subject librarians have compiled research guides for most degree programs and areas of study. Find the research guide in your discipline for an easy-to-use list of databases and other library resources that will be helpful for your research.",
