The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires  three companies to provide you with one free credit report every 12  months.  See the following U.S. Federal Trade Commission web’s page for more information. To obtain a free credit report, go to http://www.annualcreditreport.com/.   It is especially important to check your credit if your Social Security  Card or written Social Security Number was lost or stolen with your  identification."
