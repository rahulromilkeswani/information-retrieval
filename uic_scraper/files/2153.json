        "UIC’s undergraduate program in civil engineering is accredited by ABET, whose name began as an acronym for Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology. Through complex, meticulous, and rigorous examination of engineering programs across the nation, ABET identifies the undergraduate degrees that meet the highest standards of academic excellence and professional practice in preparing graduates.",
        "ABET is a federation of 28 professional and technical societies representing applied science, computing, engineering, and technology. Among the most respected accreditation organizations in the United States, ABET has provided leadership and quality assurance in higher education for more than 75 years.",
        "More than 100,000 students graduate from ABET-accredited programs each year, and millions of graduates have received degrees from ABET-accredited programs since 1932.",
        "You can find the ABET program educational objectives, student outcomes, and enrollment data for the civil engineering major on its program page."
