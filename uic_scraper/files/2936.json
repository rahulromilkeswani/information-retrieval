        "The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Chemical Engineering Department selected Vrushant Patel to receive the 2019 Henry McCormack Outstanding Senior Award. The award is given out each year by the Chicago chapter of The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).",
        "Patel is one of the top students in the department and has the highest GPA in his senior class. He has completed research in Professor Vivek Sharma’s Soft Matter Optics, Dynamics, Elasticity, and Self-Assembly (ODES) Lab.",
        "Clinical Assistant Professor Alan Zdunek said Patel has worked on visualization and characterization of beads-on-a-string formation on coated fibers using high speed imaging and measured extensional rheology response of polymer solutions using dripping-onto-substrate (DoS).",
        "He is a current member of AIChE and has received invitations to join the Engineering Honors Society of Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi. Patel has also received the Exelon Scholarship, Norman Parker Scholarship, Irene N. Jones Scholarship, J.L. Meece Scholarship, and the Ronald J. Stepansky Scholarship.",
        "Patel said he is interested in process engineering and the petroleum field and is currently pursuing employment as a process engineer after graduation.",
        "He received the award at the April 2019 Meeting and Poster Session for the Chicago section of AIChE on April 16.",
