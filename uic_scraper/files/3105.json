        "UIC’s student chapter of Institution of Transportation Engineers (ITE) captured second place at the ITE Collegiate Traffic Bowl (Midwestern District) during the ITE Midwestern District Conference 2017 at Madison, Wisconsin, from June 18 to 20.",
        "The UIC ITE team, which consists of Civil and Materials Engineering department students Diana Briones, Burbank, Illinois, and Austin Bernat, of Bartlett, Illinois, and alumnus Natalia Kuvakina, of San Jose, California, competed hard as they narrowly missed securing the top spot during their first time participating in the competition.",
        "The Midwestern District comprises of schools from Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.",
        "“Lacking any previous experience, the team’s performance was commendable in the face of stiff competition from other schools,” said Sudheer Ballare, Secretary of UIC ITE, of Mumbai, India.",
        "During the competition, the schools competed in preliminary and final rounds, which consisted of 25 questions/clues in five categories. UIC secured first place in the preliminary round, while settling for the second place in the final round. Unfortunately, UIC was edged out by the University of Minnesota.",
        "Since 2009, the ITE has been conducting a student competition program known as the ITE Collegiate Traffic Bowl. The objectives of the competition are to encourage students to become more active members in the Institute, to enhance their knowledge of the traffic/transportation engineering and planning profession and of the Institute itself, to strengthen the programs of the ITE student chapters, and to foster a collegial spirit amongst the students and professionals.",
        "The UIC ITE Student Chapter meets monthly throughout the semester. Learn more about the organization and becoming a member at https://ite.org.uic.edu."
