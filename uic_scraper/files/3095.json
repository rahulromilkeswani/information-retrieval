        "We’re kicking off a mentoring program for experienced UIC College of Engineering alumni to engage with junior and senior engineering students.",
        "What can mentoring do for you as a UIC Alumnus? Mentoring can give you an opportunity to further develop your communication and leadership skills. When sharing information about your own career path, you can provide guidance, motivation, support and role modeling. Mentoring a student offers you a way to give-back to UIC and help students become engineers.",
        "Here are the steps to take in order to join the program:",
        "We will be back in touch to see how mentoring is progressing, but feel free to reach out to us at any time during the process.",
        "Deadline to apply February 12, 2018 for a match to occur by mid-February.",
        "If you have any questions or concerns, please contact:",
        "Rose Coppola-Conroy, Director, Engineering Career Center: rcconroy@uic.edu",
        "Patrick Devanney, Associate Director, Engineering Career Center: prd@uic.edu",
        "Mentoring, from an educational perspective, is “the fundamental form of human development where one person invests time, energy, and personal know-how assisting the growth and ability of another person” (Gordon Shea). A mentor can play many roles including coach, teacher, advocate, friend, cheerleader, and opener of doors. Though a mentor may be a role model, a true mentor does not ask another person to “be like me.” A mentor says, “I will help you become whoever you wish to be.”",
        "The goal of this program is to bring together students and alumni for an exchange of information on education, professionalism, aspirations and ideas. These relationships provide a learning experience for students outside the classroom, where they have a chance to see the opportunities that a professional environment has in store for them.",
        "If you have any questions or concerns, please contact:",
