        "Always Active",
        "UIC is home to nearly 32,000 students in the heart of one of the world’s greatest cities",
        "We invite you to visit the University of Illinois at Chicago, one of the nation’s most diverse campuses and Chicago’s largest university, located just a mile from the Loop. The east side of campus is home to most undergraduate classes, student housing, the Credit Union 1 Arena, recreation facilities and Student Center East. The west side of campus includes the health sciences colleges and medical center, recreation facilities and Student Center West. The south area of campus has student housing, retail shops, athletics fields and The Isadore & Sadie Dorin Forum, a conference and events center.",
        "Besides guided tours, we offer other options, from school-specific tours to self-guided tours. We strongly encourage you to reserve a space for a school-specific, department or college tour in advance by signing up through your program office.",
        "To see photos from UIC’s guided tours, follow us on Instagram.",
        "Everyone is welcome at UIC Open House for prospective students, their families, alumni and the public. Open House hits the UIC highlights with tours of campus, speakers, sample classes, workshops and more.",
        "After a campus tour or information session, continue your UIC experience by exploring campus and the culturally rich neighborhoods nearby.",
        "The Jane Addams Hull-House Museum brings history to life. Here Addams founded America’s most famous settlement house, where generations of immigrants learned to thrive in Chicago. Social reformers at Hull-House worked for child labor laws, women’s voting rights, public health and prison reform. Today the museum promotes social justice in free gallery tours, films, talks, events and an online history.",
        "From sports to culture, UIC has ideal spots for a fun campus visit. Cheer on the UIC Flames in the Division I Horizon League. See a play at the UIC Theatre. Spend the day bowling at Student Center East, reading at the Richard J. Daley Library, working out at the Sports & Fitness Center and the Student Recreation Facility, or biking around campus.",
        "Care for a cup of coffee? Head to the Rebecca Port Faculty-Student Center Cafe in University Hall on the east side of campus, where you can surf the Web and contemplate your next move. Need a break? Have lunch at UIC. There are lots of dining options on campus.",
        "Chicago is a city of neighborhoods. Near campus, you’ll find ethnic restaurants, museums and cultural centers. Tap into the heart and soul of the area at the National Hellenic Museum in Greektown, the National Museum of Mexican Art in Pilsen, and the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in Little Italy.",
        "UIC recognizes the effects of climate change and is doing great work to help lessen our impact. Take our Green Campus Tour and learn how we recycle, generate solar-powered energy, or simply marvel in the beauty of our 5,000 trees!"
