        "Learn about the Forge Experience:",
        "Who is Forge for?",
        "Forge is for students who have just begun their leadership journey, but are seeking more.",
        "I’m looking to participate in the Spring Semester, can I?",
        "Forge is exclusively offered as a one-day program – open to all students – during the Fall Semester (make sure to plan ahead). However, students can engage with the Forge curriculum during the Spring Leadership Conference.",
        "What’s the time commitment for the program?",
        "Forge is referred to as the Fall Leadership Conference – a one-time, eight hour program that takes place late-September.",
        "How is Forge different than other leadership programs?",
        "Forge supports emerging leaders as they begin to understand the challenges they will be faced with in their roles as leaders and in their day-to-day lives. Working with the UIC Army ROTC Fire Battalion, participants have the unique opportunity to explore resiliency through the lens of a peer with different experiences than themselves. Students gain an understanding of how resiliency shows up for others, while taking away alternative methods to handling intense or stressful situations. Although focusing on the individual, Forge makes room for collaborative discussions that prepare our students for the unknown.",
        "How will my time be spent during Forge?",
        "The act of forging implies adding stress to an object to make it stronger. Throughout Forge, we aim to do just that! Participants will have the opportunity to work through conflicting case studies, reexamine themselves in moments of panic or burnout, and be coached by a collaborative staff of UIC Army ROTC Cadets and Student Leadership and Civic Engagement team members.",
        "Upon completion of the program, students gain a better sense of what resiliency looks like in action. By working through distorted perceptions and thinking traps, participants find high-stress situations to be more manageable in the unforeseeable future.",
        "The Spring 2020 Conference took place on February 15, 2020.",
        "Looking to Participate? Check back here for application details for the next Forge event at a later date."
