        "ECE Professor Igor Paprotny’s Mechatronic Systems Design Laboratory class competed with their autonomous vehicles at the end of the semester. The video has an introduction fro Professor Paprotny, and the competition starts at the 19 minute mark for those who want to jump to ahead to see the cars in action. This is only one round of the race, but shows all of the teams competing.",
        "The picture above shows the wining teams, which were team DOV (three students at right) and team Goldstar (left), who tied for first place with 17.4 second and 17.64 second lap times.",
