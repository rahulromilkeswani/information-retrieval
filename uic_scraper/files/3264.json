        "My research interests include",
        "systems security (focus: Web, Mobile, APTs), cybercrime analysis (malicious sites/URLs, exploit kits, ransomware), data-driven security, and machine learning for security. My Ph.D. dissertation leverages honeyclient emulation and machine learning for effective analysis, characterization, and detection of web-borne malware. I have also developed defense and counter-offense techniques against exploit kits. Currently, I am focusing on systematic understanding of the end-to-end machinery of malware delivery mechanisms on the Internet. I am also exploring intelligence-driven analytics to defend enterprise systems from targeted cyber-attacks.",
