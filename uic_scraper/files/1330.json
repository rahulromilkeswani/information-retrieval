        "The rate and funding model categorizes all ACCC services into three distinct categories:",
        "As the rate gets reviewed and approved every year, a central review process evaluates the services included in the bundle, prior year spending, projected future costs, changes in FTE, any subsidies that may be available, and any other factors that might affect the rate. This process ensures that centrally provided ACCC services can be sustained and enhanced as expected for a Research 1 institution.",
        "In the fall, the recharge rate for the future fiscal year is developed with input from the Rate and Funding Review Committee and the Steering Committee. Once this rate is evaluated and approved by the Policy Committee, details about the rate are distributed and reviewed during budget meetings with each college/unit. An expense transfer will be made once a year around the second quarter of the fiscal year to collect funding from each college/unit.",
