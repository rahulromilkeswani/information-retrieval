        "Chicago is a great food city, and some of our distinct flavor comes from Chicago-style pizza and hot dogs. Our deep-dish pizza is unique because of its height and the order of its ingredients: the pizza is covered in cheese then smothered in tomato sauce. Chicago hot dogs sit on a poppy-seed bun covered with mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, pickle spear, pickled peppers and celery salt — and most importantly: no ketchup!",
        "Chicago is home to the very first skyscraper. The Home Insurance Building was built in 1885 by William Le Baron Jenney. The Willis (Sears) Tower is present-day Chicago’s largest skyscraper. Built in 1970, the shape was named as the “bundle tube structure” and is famous for its two antennas. See all of Chicago’s great architecture via the many walking and bus tours as well as boat tours on the Chicago River during the warmer months. To see the city from above, check out the observation decks at Willis Tower or the Hancock Building.",
        "Legend says the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was started by a cow kicking over a lantern. It’s real cause unknown, the fire destroyed three-and-a-half square miles of the city. The Chicago Water Tower was one of the few buildings to survive and still stands today along the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago. The re-built Chicago included fireproof buildings and the first skyscraper made of steel, introducing the city to the industrial revolution.",
        "Most Chicagoans know the Loop to be the rectangular ring of elevated train tracks in the central business district, but some say that the name first referred to the downtown cable car turning loops. The officially designated community area named the Loop, however, expands beyond the “L” train hub. It stretches from Lake Michigan to the Chicago River and south to Roosevelt Road. Inside the Loop you’ll find City Hall, Millennium Park, Chicago Board of Trade, shopping on State Street, great restaurants and a variety of cultural and civic attractions.",
        "In 1909, Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett created the Plan of Chicago after studying cities across the world. The commonly-called Burnham Plan was created to improve the city so that it could better serve its growing population. One of the biggest goals of the plan was to improve and increase access to Chicago’s lakefront. Other elements included developing civic and cultural centers, larger streets, railroads and a highway system. It also introduced the grid system to the city.",
        "Although Chicago is now the third largest city in the U.S., it was second only to New York for nearly 100 years in the aftermath of the 1871 fire. Some say the nickname Second City first came from New Yorker magazine writer Abbott J. Liebling’s less-than-flattering book Chicago: The Second City. However, others say it arose like the city from the ashes of the great fire when the “second city” of Chicago was built. Whatever the origins, today you’re more likely to hear it called Chi-Town, the Windy City or Sweet Home Chicago."
