        "The UIC Library supports the research, education, service, and patient care activities of the University by ensuring that faculty, students, and other users have access to a broad and diversified range of scholarly resources, both through its own collection and through resource sharing with other institutions.  Licensed electronic resources are available at all UIC Library locations and remotely for UIC faculty, staff, and students.  Most print resources, with the exception of Special Collections and University Archives, can be readily shared with all UIC Library locations.  Through resource sharing, vast collections of materials held by other libraries are also available to UIC faculty, staff, and students.  As a public university, our collections are open to the general public.",
        "UIC liaison librarians communicate with members of the University community to identify resources needed for research, education, and patient care needs.  As both academic programs and the resources that support them evolve and change, liaisons strive to meet new information needs and optimize the collection within budgetary constraints. If you like, you may recommend an item for the library to purchase.",
        "Special Collections and University Archives and the UIC digital image collections will be covered by other policies which are under development.",

        "The UIC Library is part of CARLI I-Share, an Illinois network of 91 member libraries that share a merged catalog, enabling UIC users to request material from another CARLI I-Share library without mediation.  This gives UIC users access to a statewide collection of 14.7 million titles.  The UIC Library also offers patrons traditional interlibrary loan services for books, journal articles, and other formats.",
        "The UIC Library is a member of the Center for Research Libraries, which has a vast collection of international newspapers, journals, documents, dissertations, archives, and other print and digital resources available to members.  The CRL catalog can be found online.  UIC patrons must make an appointment and show a valid i-card to use the CRL collection on site, and can also request materials through inter-library loan.  UIC patrons can also use other Chicago libraries, details can be found here: https://library.uic.edu/help/article/1963/use-other-non-uic-libraries/.",
        "UIC is a member of HathiTrust, “an international community of research libraries committed to the long-term curation and availability of the cultural record” through “common efforts and a deep commitment to the public good.”  The HathiTrust collection is available online and in the I-Share catalog. Anyone can use items in the public domain; and additional resources may be used as needed by patrons who are print-disabled or blind.  The HathiTrust collection grows continually as member libraries contribute content.",
        "The UIC Library collections have been greatly enhanced by generous gifts.  Monetary donations may be made.  Due to space considerations and the costs of processing gifts, donations of books, journals, and other print content are carefully evaluated by liaison librarians before acceptance.  Items widely held in Illinois and available via I-Share for borrowing will likely not be added.  Once accepted, the UIC Library owns the gift materials and may choose to dispose of them.",
        "Scholarly communication “is the system through which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future use” (ACRL – Association of College & Research Libraries). The advent of electronic publishing affords opportunities to change traditional models of scholarship dissemination and to make materials open to the public, known as open access.  The UIC Library is facilitating changes in scholarly communication through an institutional repository (INDIGO), an open access publishing fund, memberships in key open access initiatives, and an open access journal publishing platform.  More information can be found at our pages on Publishing, Scholarly Communication, and Open Access.",
