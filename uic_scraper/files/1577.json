    "title": "Undergraduate Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses and Repeating A Course with Grade Point Average Recalculation Prior to Fall 2017 | UIC Office of the Registrar",
    "text": [
        "Students may repeat a  course to increase their knowledge of the subject matter. There are  circumstances under which repeating a course is advisable and to a student’s advantage.  There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage a  student and narrow a student’s options. Some colleges require students to  discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic advisor before they  register to repeat the course.",
        "Courses with A or B  grades may not be repeated. Normally, courses with a C grade may not be  repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once without written  permission. In all cases, the original grade for the course and the grade for  each repeat will appear on the transcript. The original grade will be  calculated into the grade point average, unless the student initiates a request  for Repeating a Course with Grade Point  Average Recalculation as described below. Only one registration for  the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A  course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the  repeat course is a prerequisite.",
        "To repeat a course more  than once requires written permission from the student’s college dean. Students  who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat  courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should consult their  college before repeating a course.",
        "Important Note: Grade point average  recalculation for a repeated course is  not automatic. The student must initiate a request in the  college office as outlined below.",
        "For the grade point  average recalculation policy to apply, a student must declare to his or her  college the intent to repeat a course for a change of grade. Students must  submit this request to their college before the end of the official add/drop  period, no later than the second Friday of the fall and spring semesters, the  first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2.  The course must be repeated within three semesters of the receipt of the  original grade, and it must be taken at UIC. Only one registration for the  course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation.",
        "The new Repeating a Course and GPA Recalculation policies apply to all  undergraduate students entering UIC in Fall 2009 or later. Continuing  students who entered UIC before Fall 2009 may select one of two options. They  may either follow the old Grade  Forgiveness policy found under University  Degree Requirements in the Undergraduate  Catalog in effect at the time of their admission to UIC. Or, they may  follow the new Repeating a Course and GPA Recalculation policies. Continuing students cannot follow both policies. The Repeating  a Course and GPA Recalculation policies can be applied only to courses taken after the policies took effect,  i.e. to courses taken during the Fall 2009 term or later.  For example,  because the Repeating a Course and GPA Recalculation policies took effect  in Fall 2009, Spring 2010 graded courses will be the first opportunity students  will have to retake and exclude a Fall 2009 course from their GPA.",
