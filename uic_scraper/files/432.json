        "The UIC Library welcomes users with disabilities, and is committed to providing accessible services, spaces and resources for everyone.  The following information aims to assist users with disabilities to effectively use the Library.",
        "If there are additional accessibility services you would find helpful, or you have any questions, please let us know by contacting the Library Accessibility Committee at lib-access@uic.edu.",
        "Make an appointment with a librarian to discuss your research assignments and identify relevant resources. One option is to meet online, sharing a screen to walk through the search process together. To work in person with a librarian and a sign language interpreter, please use this form to request an interpreter. It is recommended that you allow one week’s notice for this.",
        "Other options to get help.",
        "Anyone may request that books be pulled for picked up at the front desk:",
        "As staffing permits, Library staff can also accompany students and employees who need assistance to the stacks in order to browse and retrieve books.",
        "Patrons with disabilities can designate a proxy, another person who has authority to check out books for you using their own i-cards.",
        "Assign a person to check out your materials.",
        "Students in need of alternate format of inaccessible library materials must first register with the Disability Resource Center (DRC), then fill out the Alternate Format Request Form. The DRC and the Library work collaboratively through this process to ensure students have equitable access to educational materials in a timely manner.",
        "Faculty and staff who have requested and received an accommodation from the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) may place requests for materials by contacting their nearest ILL office using the relevant email address listed below.",
        "The library has screen reader software and text magnification software in the Daley Library and the Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago, and some of these are installed on computers on adjustable tables.",
        "Learn more about assistive technology.",
        "Accessible WEPA printers are available in the Daley Library (IDEA Commons) and in the Library of Health Sciences, Chicago.",
        "Both Daley and the Library of the Health Sciences have designated quiet areas that are available for all students.",
        "In the Daley Library, the Circle Reading Room is an enclosed room on the first floor of the library that is a designated quiet space. Also, the third and fourth floors are both designated as quiet floors.",
        "In the Library of the Health Sciences, there is a large quiet enclosed reading room (107) on the first floor, and also the third floor is the designated quiet floor.",
        "The Daley Library has a room reserved for students who require individual, distraction-free study space.  Registration is available online.  Please note this is a limited resource; priority should be given to students requiring accommodations.",
        "In the Daley Library, there are multi-stall restrooms on all four floors that have a wheelchair accessible stall. On the second floor, there is a gender-inclusive, single person restroom which is wheelchair accessible.",
        "In the Library of the Health Sciences, there are multi-stall restrooms with a wheelchair accessible stall on the lower level and the third floor. The first floor has a gender-inclusive, single person restroom which is wheelchair accessible.",
        "Service dogs are welcome in the UIC Library. Service dogs are trained to do specific tasks and must be under control at all times. Therapy and emotional support animals that do not perform specific tasks are not permitted in the UIC Library.",
        "When elevators are not in service proceed to the designated Area of Rescue Assistance or nearest stairwell if you can and wait there to be evacuated by a member of the UIC Police Department (UICPD) or an emergency responder.",
        "If possible, ask a member of the library staff or another person to accompany you to the stairwell. Ask the person to immediately inform UICPD and/or other emergency responders of your exact location (floor, stairwell number, ect.) once the person has evacuated.",
        "Once in the stairwell, call UICPD (312-355-5555) for help; if no help arrives in 5-10 minutes, call again.",
        "The University of Illinois at Chicago is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, courses, services and activities at UIC. Individuals with concerns about the library should contact Mary Case, University Librarian at marycase@uic.edu or (312) 996-2716.",
