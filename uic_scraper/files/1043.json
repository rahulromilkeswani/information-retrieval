        "Each aid program may have additional requirements such as Expected Family Contribution (EFC), financial need, etc. Refer to each program for specific information about eligibility.",
        "International Students:",
        "International students are not eligible for federal, state or institutional need-based financial aid. For more information regarding aid resources, please contact the Office of International Services.",

If you have a conviction(s) for these offenses, call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) or click here to complete the \"Student Aid Eligibility Worksheet\" to find out how this law applies to you.",

        "Repeated Coursework:",
        "Federal regulations state that a student can receive aid for a previously passed course (D or greater) only once if the student is again receiving credit for the course. SFAS and Registrar will verify this information each semester. Financial aid awards will be recalculated for students registered for a course in which they have already received two passing grades."
