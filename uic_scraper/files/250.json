        "Despite significant advances in programming languages and verification tools, programming remains a tedious, error-prone, and expensive activity. This talk surveys an emerging approach to software design in which a programmer and an automated program-synthesis tool collaborate to generate software that meets its specification. A programmer expresses her insights about the design using synthesis artifacts of different kinds such as programs that may contain ambiguities, declarative specifications of high-level requirements, positive and negative examples of desired behaviors, and optimization criteria for selecting among alternative implementations. The synthesis tool composes these different views about the structure and functionality of the system into a unified concrete implementation using a combination of algorithmic techniques such as decision procedures for constraint-satisfaction problems, iterative schemes for abstraction and refinement, and data-driven learning. We will illustrate this approach using a number of projects, including one at Penn focusing on design of cache coherence protocols from a mix of concrete and symbolic execution scenarios.",
