When the weather turns too cool for the picnic groves, climbing wall and play garden, try the ice-skating ribbon.",

        "Chicago offers endless opportunities for a cultural experience, from museums to music, dance and art.",
        "Tied together by green space, the Museum Campus is home to world-renowned institutions of art and artifacts.

The Adler Planetarium shows visitors outer space and beyond, and the Shedd Aquarium is filled with colorful reefs and sea creatures sure to make everyone smile.",
        "Other cultural offerings include the Chicago History Museum, which showcases the city’s past and future, the Art Institute and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Chicago is home to extraordinary musical talent, such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Lyric Opera of Chicago. Less formal but just as rewarding, Ravinia is only a train ride away.

        "Chicago may be known for its cold and snowy weather, but there’s plenty of winter fun, indoors and outdoors.",

        "During the holiday season, Lincoln Park Zoo has Zoolights, a sparkling outdoor delight of more than 2 million lights with musical shows and 3D displays. To escape the cold, Navy Pier’s indoor Winter Wonderfest offers dazzling lights, holiday activities, food, drink, an ice rink and rides.",
        "The Garfield Park Conservatory is one of the largest and most amazing botanical conservatories in the nation and is often referred to as, “landscape art under glass.” It offers a beautiful and warm respite to the chill winter air outside."
