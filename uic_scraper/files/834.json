        "UIC is an officially recognized Bike Friendly University.",
        "As an official Bike Friendly University, the University of Illinois at Chicago is well connected to Chicago’s on-street bike network, and has bike parking at nearly every campus building.  Several Divvy stations on the UIC campus provide convenient transportation for getting around on campus or commuting from downtown train stations. UIC earned its BFU silver status in 2013.",
        "Chicagoland’s bike share system, Divvy, offers discounted annual memberships for all UIC students, faculty, and staff.  Sign up for the UIC Membership Plan with your @uic.edu or @uillinois.edu email address and enter program code GoFlames.",
        "Sign up at https://www.divvybikes.com/pricing/student  with program code GoFlames. Any questions?  Contact Kate Yoshida.",
        "Talk to a Divvy customer service representative if you are a current member looking to renew at the discounted rate.",
        "Bicycle lanes are legal street designations intended for bicycle traffic only.  The use of these areas for temporary parking is prohibited and carries a penalty of $150.  Vehicles parked in bicycle lanes force bicycle riders into the lane of traffic, creating a dangerous situation for the rider and other drivers.  All UIC staff, faculty and students are strongly urged and cautioned to refrain from parking vehicles in these unauthorized locations. Those who ride bicycles and all pedestrians are likewise advised to observe traffic control devices and crosswalks, and to be alert at all times to their surroundings.",
        "To report a vehicle in a bike lane:",
        "Call the City of Chicago at 311",
        "Call the UIC Police at 312-996-2830",
        "If you need more air in your bike tires, you can use a Fix-It Station or visit one of the student centers and borrow a Bike Pump. The student centers also stock Repair Kits. Visit the Manager Service Window on the first floor to rent out a repair kit or bike pump with a valid i-Card. Fix-It stations are located outside SCE near the east and west entrances. There is also a Fix-It Station just outside of the MSB entrance at 835 W. Wolcott Ave.",
        "If you are a member of Campus Rec, you can rent a bike tool kit after swiping your i-Card. If you are a resident in Campus Housing, check out one of the bike repair kits.",
        "Should you need to shower before going to work or class, simply visit one of the Rec centers on campus and you can use the showers in the locker rooms for up to 30 minutes. (Open to all UIC faculty, students & staff with valid i-Card and bike helmet.)",
        "Always lock your bike to a secured bike rack with a U-lock around the frame and the wheel. Use a cable around the other wheel and the U-lock to double-down on your anti-theft techniques. Trust us!"
