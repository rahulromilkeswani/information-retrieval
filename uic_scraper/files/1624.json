        "Our department offers three minors: civil engineering, environmental engineering, and materials engineering. These minors require between 18 and 20 semester hours, independent of any prerequisite courses.",
        "Minors are available to engineering students as well as students in UIC’s other undergraduate colleges: the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Business. They are a great way to diversify your undergraduate degree and add specificity in an area of engineering that interests you.",
        "Follow the links below for the course catalog pages on each minor. If you are thinking about pursuing a minor, contact your academic advisor to ensure that you meet the requirements and to coordinate these courses in your schedule."
