        "The UIC John Marshall Law School offers three types of professional degrees: Juris Doctor (JD), Master of Laws (LLM), and Master of Jurisprudence (MJ).",
        "The JD program requires completion of 90 hours: 53 required core hours, including 3 hours of clinical or externship course work, and 37 elective hours. JD students may earn an optional JD concentration in one of four areas:",
        "LLM programs are offered in seven specialty areas of law:",
        "Each LLM program requires completion of 30 hours. The number of required versus elective course credits varies depending on the program, ranging between 8–15 required hours. Admission to an LLM program requires a JD degree or equivalent foreign degree.",
        "The MJ program requires completion of 30 hours. Students in the MJ program will select a concentration in one of the seven specialty areas of law in which the Law School has an LLM program. The number of required versus elective course hours varies depending on the concentration, ranging between 9–19 required hours. In contrast with the LLM program, the MJ program does not require a JD or equivalent foreign degree for admission.",
