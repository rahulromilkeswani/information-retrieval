        "The purpose of the Graduate College&rsquo;s (GC) Fellows Mentoring and Support Initiative is to expand outreach efforts to Diversifying Faculty in Higher Education in Illinois (DFI) and Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln) Fellowship recipients at UIC. DFI and Lincoln Fellows have access to additional mentoring, advice, and referral support from GC faculty and staff.&nbsp; Fellows can meet in a &quot;home a way from home&quot; setting to engage in various career development workshops, scholarly, and community-building events. Ms. Demetria Ward-Kato will serve as the contact person for both Lincoln and DFI fellows. The GC Assistant and Associate Deans and other staff will serve as mentors. In the near future, we will expand the mentoring network to include alumni recipients of the DFI and Lincoln Fellowships.",
