        "The J-1 student visa is more appropriate for students who  are on exchange visits or sponsored programs. J-1 student visas are  usually issued when a student receives most or all of their funding from  their home government or a U.S. governmental agency. The dependents of a  J-1 visa holder are granted J-2 visas.  J-2 visa holders may enroll in  school and apply for work authorization.  If you receive a DS-2019 document, you should apply for a J-1 visa.",
        "Caution:  Individuals are not eligible to register for classes if their visa  status is B1/B2, WB/WT-Visa Waiver or F2 (Dependent of F1).  If you have  any questions about visa types, please email newintl@uic.edu.",
        "",
        "What is a visa? A visa is a stamp in your passport from the  U.S. Consulate or Embassy abroad that permits you to apply for entry  into the U.S. at a Port of Entry. It only needs to be valid for your entry into  the U.S. and does not have to remain valid throughout your stay  provided that you maintain your immigration status. This means that as  long as you remain within U.S. borders, your visa is allowed to expire.  However, your I-20 or DS-2019 must remain valid for the duration of your  stay in the U.S.",
        "How to obtain a visa. Once you are admitted to the  University of Illinois at Chicago, you will need to obtain a student  visa for your initial entry to the U.S.",
        "OIS will send you an I-20 or DS-2019. Once you have this document,  you should review it to make sure the information is correct and sign  the document. Please email newintl@uic.edu if you have any questions or  concerns about your document.",
        "",
        "The following are recommended steps when applying for your F-1/J-1 visa:",
        "To obtain a visa, you need to prepare the following documents for your visa interview:",
        "You should be prepared to show:",
        "Applicants with dependents must also provide:",
        "Importance of Name Consistency",
        "To avoid problems or delays in obtaining your visa and entering the  U.S., be sure that all of your immigration documents reflect the same  name, exactly as it appears in your passport.",
        "Do not use nicknames or shortened names on any of your documents,  including your passport, I-20 or DS-2019, entry visa stamp, I-94 card  (completed in the airplane before arrival for individuals arriving before 04/26/2013) and any additional  documents that you acquire after your arrival in the U.S.",
        "Visa Wait Times",
        "Visa wait times vary from country to country. The U.S. Department of  State  offers  average wait times. In general, it is important for students to  apply  for their visa as soon as they have all the necessary documents,  ideally  at least 120 days before the start of the semester.",
        "Certain nonimmigrant visa applicants are subject to additional  administrative processing  and/or  security clearances before being issued a visa. This involves  the U.S.  Consulate or Embassy checking the visa applicant’s name  against  information in various Department of State (DOS) databases or a  security  advisory opinion.",
        "At the initial visa interview, the applicant should provide clear and   concise information about their past activities and future plans while   in the U.S.  In most cases, the visa is issued within 60 days.",
        "",
        "F-1 Students:",
        "Immigration regulations allow entry into the U.S. up to 30 days  before the start date on the I-20.  If you are unable to arrive by your  start date, please consider deferring (or delaying) your admission to  the next semester. If you are a graduate student, you must first defer  your admission with your department. Please notify OIS if you plan to  defer.",
        "J-1 Students:",
        "The DS-2019 has been prepared for the period of time indicated in  Section 3 of the form. You may enter the U.S. up to 30 days before the  start date.",
        "For F-1 and J-1 students:",
        "Plan your arrival date in Chicago so you can:",
        "You may want to prepare for your entry into the U.S. by visiting the website of Customs and Border Patrol.  Additionally,  when you enter the U.S., an immigration officer (at the  port of entry) will review your immigration documents (visa,  I-20/DS-2019, valid passport).",
        "After you pass through immigration, you’ve officially arrived. Welcome to the United States!",

        "Name (Blocks 1, 2, 14, and 15)",
        "The family name (Blocks 1 and 14) is also referred to as surname or  last name. If you have only one name, enter it in the Family Name block.  Use the letters FNU in the First Name field. Spacing is as important as spelling and must be consistent. For example: data systems will not read Mc Millan and McMillan as the same name. Hyphens must not be used.",
        "",
        "Print your name exactly as it appears on your Form I-20.",
        "",
        "Date of Birth (Blocks 3 and 16) and Date Issued (Block 11): Your date of birth must be given in Day/Month/Year order. This is not the same order that appears on your Form I-20 or Form DS-2019.  For example: if you were born on the 9th day of January in the year  1986, you should write 090186 in the Birth Date block (Blocks 3 and 16).  The same date format is used in block 11 for Date Issued.",
        "Country of Citizenship (Blocks 4 and 17): In the  Country of   Citizenship block enter the country that issued your  passport. You can find the U.S. spelling in block 1 of the Form I-20  under the “Country of Citizenship.” It is on the second line of the Form  DS-2019 under “Citizenship Country.”",

        "All students living on campus are required to fulfill the immunization requirements  mandated by Illinois state law. We recommend that you obtain all the  necessary immunizations before you arrive in the U.S. You are required  to turn in a completed immunization form to the university before the  end of your first semester of study. If you fail to comply with the  immunization requirements, a hold will be placed on your registration  the following semester.  You may download the immunization form from the  Office of Admissions & Records website."
