        "The University of Illinois System pumps $17.5 billion into the Illinois economy annually — including $7.6 billion from UIC — and supports 171,000 jobs, which accounts for one in every 46 jobs across the state, according to a new economic impact study.",
        "The study found that UIC contributes $7.6 billion to the state economy annually. That accounts for 1 percent of gross state product and is also larger than the state’s arts, entertainment and recreation industry. The university supports about 73,500 jobs, representing one of every 106 jobs across the state.",
        "For every dollar that UIC students put into their education, they receive $5.30 in career earnings – a 16.5 percent annual return. The average bachelor’s degree graduate will earn $29,500 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.3 million more in career earnings."
