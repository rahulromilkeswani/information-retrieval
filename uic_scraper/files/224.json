        "We believe that a new generation of OS semantics is both necessary and possible. The need which will drive new OS adoption is security. Ethos indicates what is possible with such a design philosophy.",
        "Ethos will be released as open source. We are targetting MinimaLT, a secure network protocol, as our first release. MinimaLT is developed within Ethos, and will be ported to POSIX. We intend to release a research prototype in the Spring Semester, followed by a production code."
