MGIB-AD eligibility requirements include at least two years of continuous active duty service. If you are on active duty, consult with your base Education Services Officer (ESO) before submitting an application for VA benefits to discuss the various educational assistance opportunities available.

        "The Post 9/11-GI Bill pays a percentage of tuition and fees, a monthly housing allowance (if your rate of pursuit* exceeds 50%), and a stipend for books and supplies. The $600 buy up payable under the Montgomery GI Bill and REAP is not payable under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.",

        "*Rate of pursuit applies to Post-9/11 GI Bill only and refers to the number of credit hours you are taking divided by the number of credits considered full-time by the university (rounded to the nearest tenth). The VA considers any rate of pursuit higher than 50% to be more than half time. Effective August 1, 2011, monthly housing allowance benefits are prorated based upon rate of pursuit, rounded to the nearest tenth.",
        "This program pays a monthly benefit based on enrollment status. These benefits are available to dependents of:",
        "This is an educational program for active members of the Selected Reserve and provides a monthly stipend based on enrollment status. Chapter 1606 eligibility is determined by the Department of Defense. Basic eligibility requires a six-year obligation to serve in the Selected Reserve and satisfactory participation in required Selected Reserve training.",
        "This educational benefit is for certain Reservists who were activated after September 11, 2001. Eligible recipients receive a monthly stipend based on enrollment status and period of service. To be eligible, you must be a member of a reserve component and have performed active service for a minimum of 90 consecutive days. Additional benefits may be available under the Post-9/11 GI Bill."
