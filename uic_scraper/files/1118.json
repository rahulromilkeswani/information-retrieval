        "The Council on Teacher Education (CTE) is the professional education unit for the University of Illinois at Chicago responsible for coordinating Professional Educator Licensure (PEL) programs and maintaining the State of Illinois Licensure requirements.",
        "Decisions about licensure are a joint effort of a candidate’s program, the Council on Teacher Education (CTE), and the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE). The program coordinator and faculty have the main responsibility for ensuring that candidates are prepared to become licensed teachers and are, thus, entitled to apply for licensure. They approve qualifications before the CTE begins its process of evaluation. The CTE’s licensure officer entitles an individual to apply for a license at the state level. The CTE checks that candidates have met state requirements, such as passing the required state-level tests and completing the course, assessment, and grade requirements stipulated by the program as addressing state objectives. ISBE makes the final decision about whether or not a candidate receives licensure based upon the information it receives from the institution and a candidate’s application.",
        "CTE serves programs in the College of Education, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, the College of Nursing, and the Jane Addams College of Social Work.",

        "To be eligible for student teaching, candidates must meet the following criteria:",
        "To become licensed, candidates must have done the following:",
        "Before the license is issued, the candidate must also pass a series of examinations required by the Illinois State Board of Education. The ACT or SAT and any alternative test of basic skills as defined by the Illinois State Board of Education, must be passed prior to gaining full admission to candidacy with the Council on Teacher Education. b",
        "All tests are valid indefinitely.  The Illinois Content Area Test must be passed before the candidate is allowed to student teach.  Lastly, a teaching license is not issued until a student passes the final performance assessment, the EdTPA.",
        "For information on application procedures, contact the Council on Teacher Education located at 1333 S. Halsted, Suite 205.",
        "Effective March 2003, Illinois \"Approved Program Verification\" forms and applications for Illinois teaching licenses will no longer be signed based solely on completion of a teacher education program if that program was completed more that three years prior to the verification request. The faculty in relevant colleges and departments will evaluate the records of program completers based on UIC’s current program requirements and make recommendations regarding licensure.",
        "The Illinois State Board of Education occasionally changes the requirements for licensure. For current information, contact the academic advisor in the major field of study or the Council on Teacher Education.",
        "Teacher candidates are responsible for bearing the expense of the TB test and the criminal background check.",
        "Candidates must meet the applicable numerical passing scores that were in place at the time the test was taken.",
        "The University of Illinois at Chicago offers several secondary teacher education programs located in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS). Through LAS, the student can study the Teaching of English, Teaching of French, Teaching of German, Teaching of History, Teaching of Mathematics, and Teaching of Spanish. The programs provide for the development of a major field of study with an emphasis on teaching. Please consult the home college for more information about these degree requirements.",
