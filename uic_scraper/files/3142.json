    "text": [
        "The research in UIC Distinguished Professor Alexander Yarin’s Multiscale Mechanics and Nanotechnology Laboratory is flooding the science community. A paper by Yarin and his team members’ about using bubble recoil to cool microelectronics was recently published in the journal Nature Microgravity. The work, titled “Swing-like Pool Boiling on Nano-Textured Surfaces for Microgravity Applications Related to Cooling of High-Power Microelectronics,” originated from the team’s work on a NASA-funded project. Stories about the team’s research have been published in Phys.org, Engineering.com, AZoNano.com, New electronics.co.uk, and UIC News.",
