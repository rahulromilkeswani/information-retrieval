        "What:Ludum Dare is a Game Development \"jam\" and competition. It is an online event but since it's lonely working alone and difficult to find others to work with, we created this event so everybody can get together and make teams to create something cool!",
        "When:",
        "Starts at 8 PM on Friday the 17th and goes until Sunday night, although the website allows you to submit up until 8 PM on Monday. Please try to arrive at 7:30 PM so we can get things organized and form teams (optional).",
        "Who can come:",
        "Anybody! Even if you've never made a game, anybody can contribute. There are some really simple game engines out there like GameMaker or Scratch which make it possible for anybody to design games.",
        "What you'll need:",
        "Bring any tools you need for your craft; laptops for programmers, instruments for musicians, drawing tablets for artists, etc.",
        "Teams:",
        "At 7:45 PM we will get everybody together and vote on two ways to make teams:",
        "A) Form your own, walk around and find programmers if you're an artist and vice versa.",
        "B) Tell us what your skills are and we will form balanced teams. Reduces the whole awkward human interaction thing.",

        "SIG Sysadmin will be having its first meeting this upcoming Tuesday February 3rd at 5PM in SELE 2264, the room next to the ACM Office. The meeting agenda will consist of an introduction for new members to the SIG and the workspace in SELE 2264, a hardware demonstration, and collecting feedback for future workshops and presentations. We will also be touching base with continuing members, what they have been working on, and what progress still needs to be made.",

The agenda will be assigning specific admin roles, any outstanding project setup, and project progress. If you have started a project, please make sure to attend this meeting so progress can be checked all at once.  Walter Dworak",
        "Hi guys!",
        "I thought I'd take a moment to talk about one of our SIGs. As time goes on, I'll talk to more of our sigs and let you know what they're up to, but seeing as how SIG App met today, we'll start with them.",
        "SIG App has been doing a lot with JS development and has some exciting meetings coming up. So far they've worked with basic JS and a few of the core libraries, useful for front end, back end, and database access development. Today particularly they went over using JS libraries to access Mongo DB (a popular database system). Jeff Gensler (head of SIG App) is doing a lot to help people become webapp developers. Next week, those who have been attending thus far will be giving presentations on libraries they haven't discussed yet. For those of you who are unaware, libraries are add-ons to the language in order to provide functionality not included in the standard release. If you're looking for a single SIG App meeting to go to, this would be a great one! We look forward to what they're doing, and with any grace, the apps they develop by the end of the semester.",

        "Just a reminder for the SIG Sysadmin meeting tonight at 5:30PM in SEL 2264.  Today will be the guided Arch Linux installation in a VM. You will need access to a machine with SSH and internet access.   -Walter",
        "Meeting reminder that there will be a SIG meeting today at 5:30pm and we will initially be meeting at SEL 2264. We will be doing the guided installation session today so anyone that has not yet gotten their ACM accounts setup will either need to beforehand or message me directly. I will be working around people not having an account for this meeting only, since it will be the first one that requires it.   Walter Dworak",

        "Hey Guys,",
        "So this is the official announcement I promised at the meeting yesterday and have a time and date for the first SIG Sysadmin meeting. As noted in the subject it will be at 5:30pm Monday, September 8th in SELE 2264. I would have liked to give people more lead time in notice, but unfortunately it currently looks like has to either be this coming Monday or get pushed back a week.",
        "If you are interesting in joining or just want to get more information on the SIG, but this time and day does not work at all then please send me an email to wdwora2 AT uic DOT edu and include some of your schedule details so we can work something out and if enough people respond I will look into other possibilities.",
        "The agenda for the meeting will be a general introduction of any current and potential members to the work space, systems, some software/hardware concepts, and to get a general idea of where everyone is at in experience and interests as to better plan for future meetings and get a many people moving in the right direction as possible from the get go. Before then I invite everyone to check out our SIGs area of the website, https://acm.cs.uic.edu/sigsysadmin, and our wiki, https://acm.cs.uic.edu/wiki, to start getting an idea of what things the ACM currently has, what some of our members have done so far, and to start thinking about what you would like to do and get out of the organization.",
