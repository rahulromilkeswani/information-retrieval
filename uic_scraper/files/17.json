        "Plan to arrive in Chicago and on campus to give yourself plenty of time to find housing, remove registration holds, enroll in classes, attend various campus-wide orientations (refer to section below), complete hiring paperwork if you were offered aid (see “New hire paperwork” accordion below), and get familiar with the campus.",
        "International students on a visa typically can enter the country 30 days prior to the start of the term.",
