        "Association for Computer Machinery is an association for computer machinists. We hold a variety of talks, including bringing in companies, bringing technical experts, and having university professors discuss their research. We're trying to get some of the best talks this year of all time. It's a great way to advance your career and network, and if you want to comment on the way the organization is being run, you can come to our special town hall meetings for specifically discussing the organization. We also run a variety of Special Interest Groups, which are great ways to get involved with projects, and the famous SIG-Fun which is how we all relax from CS and get to know our classmates. We play games (board and computer), and hold movie nights. Great way to socialize.",
        "If you actually join ACM you will get access to an ACM account on our persistent linux servers with a variety of abilities such as server space and access to ACM resources--this includes wifi and LAN access (much better than UIC wifi, and no we're not kidding). You also get access to the ACM library! I currently have two books checked out, it's really useful if you need information on a specific topic... You get to go to Reflections Projections. You want to go to that and see some serious speaks and hang out with some serious cool peeps. All this for only $10.",
