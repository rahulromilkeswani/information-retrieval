        "UIC’s student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) brings together students who want to understand and contribute to the computing technology around them. This group serves as a bridge between the CS department and students, providing tutoring and assistance to everyone taking CS courses. Events include LAN parties, lectures by guest speakers, and the ICPC programming competition. ACM also supports student-led Special Interest Groups (SIGs), which give students opportunities to learn about and work with technologies including AI, blockchain, game development, systems administration, and DevOps.",
