        "The SURF program is located on UIC’s West Campus, in the center of the Illinois Medical District–one of the largest concentrations of advanced health care facilities in the nation– and just minutes from downtown Chicago. Our location gives us convenient access to a diverse range of cutting-edge research, collaborators and patient populations.",
        "The SURF Program is funded by an institutional award from the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET).",
        "The SURF program runs for 10 weeks, starting on Monday, June 1, 2020 and ending on Friday, August 7, 2020.",
        "ASPET-sponsored SURF program is for undergraduate students interested in biomedical research.  Students will work on independent research projects in the laboratories of their faculty mentors.  Before beginning work, students will attend relevant laboratory safety training.  In addition to individual mentoring, the program offers number of enrichment activities:  research seminars, advanced research instrumentation workshops, career day at a local pharmaceutical company, instructions on how to prepare a scientific presentation, practice talks and  a mini-symposium where all the participants present their research projects in front of the College audience.  SURF participants will receive compensation of $3,000 for the 10 week period. New in 2020: the SURF program will pay for travel to/from UIC at the beginning/end of the summer. Details will be discussed with fellows once they are accepted into the program.",

        "Participating in research through the College of Pharmacy was an excellent method for exposing me to different research techniques and applications of organic chemistry. It was wonderful to learn first-hand about different chemical processes commonly employed in medicinal chemistry research, and I am excited to bring my newly acquired knowledge back to my home institution and help train other students I work with.",
        "I wish I would be working on the same project for the fall semester! I am planning on coming back to apply to graduate school. I had such a good experience here.",

        "2017 Fellow Sarah Colon Plaza (left, Mankin/Vazquez-Laslop lab), 2018 Fellow Brenna Kirkpatrick (middle, Burdette lab), and 2019 Fellow Rocío Rivera Rodríguez (right, Burdette lab) have all been accepted into graduate programs for the Fall of 2020. Sarah will be entering the PharmD/PhD Concurrent Degree Program at the University of Colorado after graduating from the Universidad de Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus with a BS in Biochemistry in May. Brenna, who graduated last year with a BS in Biochemistry from the University of Kentucky and has been working as a Research Technician in the Burdette lab, will matriculate into UIC’s Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD).  Rocío will finish her Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry at the Universidad de Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus this spring before heading back to UIC to join the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences PhD program. Congratulations to our fellows on their accomplishments!",
        "2016 Fellow and current P3 in the UIC College of Pharmacy PharmD program Alex Infante (left, Thomas lab) was accepted as an Interprofessional Approaches to Healthcare Disparities (IAHD) Scholar.  He is working with an interdisciplinary team hosted in the College of Medicine and completed a collaborative research project with the Lincoln Park Community Shelter to educate their staff on the application of Naloxone in cases of opioid overdoses. Alex presented a poster for that work at the Patient Centered Medicine-Service Learning Program (PCM-SLP)-IAHD Virtual Showcase on April 16, 2020 with the title “Impact of Naloxone Training on the Homeless Community”.",
