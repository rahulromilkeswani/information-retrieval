        "Honors College students are often invited to join a variety of national honors societies and local chapters. The following are ones supported by the Honors College. The decision to join an honor society, whether included on this list or not, is an individual decision, and you are encouraged to look into each honor society’s benefits, fees, local chapter activity, and more as you are making your decision to join.",
