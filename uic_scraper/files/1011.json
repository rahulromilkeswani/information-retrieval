        "Taking place the first Monday of each month, in partnership with multiple campus partners, this regular service opportunity allows students to give back while they are on campus. This enables students who don't have the time or resources to serve in other ways to still contribute to community organizations. Projects are usually hands on and involve making something. They vary from month to month and have included making fleece-tie blankets for infants of teen parents, assembling welcome kits for hospice patients, creating cards for veterans, making dog toys for shelter animals, and more. Make your Mondays Matter!",
        "Make Mondays Matter projects happen at different locations on campus every month. To find where and when the next project is, please check out our volunteer a service portal at service.uic.edu for exact details every month."
