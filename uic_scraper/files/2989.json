        "In January, we shared an announcement that Foursquare was opening a new Midwest engineering hub. We are pleased to update that 7 months later we have hit our goal of building a team of six, and are looking to expand even more. After being so impressed by the caliber of talent in the market and early impact of the group there, we have decided to significantly grow the Chicago team."
