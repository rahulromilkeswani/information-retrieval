        "On behalf of the University of Illinois at Chicago Office of Technology Management (OTM), in partnership with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is opening a call for submissions for the Chancellor’s Translational Research Initiative (CTRI).",
        "This CTRI funding is available to support projects that have high potential for commercialization, but are in preparation for proof of concept funding through Illinois Ventures or to have enough translational data for licensing by industrial partners, typically TRL 4 or lower. Eligible applicants are full time faculty, staff, and researchers who have a CFOP account. Achievement of these early milestones, which are difficult to attract funding through alternate sources, will make them more attractive for licensing or start-up opportunities.  The end goal of this program is to advance UIC innovations to a commercialization outcome.  UIC faculty innovators have the opportunity to receive up to $25,000 per project, to advance technology originating at UIC. The Winter 2020 cycle closes on January, 2020 for submission of applications.",
        "Applications Open: December 10th, 2019",
        "Deadline: January 27th, 2020 by 5:00 pm CST",
        "Projects must be submitted in PDF format by January 27th, 2020. Timestamps will be noted and there will be no exceptions for proposals received past 5:00 pm. Questions should be sent to OTMAWARD@uic.edu as well for a prompt response.",
        "All proposals must be based on a UIC technology that has been disclosed to the OTM or after completion of the milestone in submitted proposal would result in a disclosure to OTM.",
        "Projects will be reviewed on the basis of technological soundness, commercial market attractiveness and feasibility to meet milestones. Successful proposals will demonstrate outstanding scientific and technological merit whose results can advance the TRL, result in novel intellectual property (IP), and have potential to license to an industrial partner or to an investor-backed start-up company.",
        "Project proposals must contain the following sections and be no longer than 3 pages in length.",
        "Innovators will have 4 months to complete their projects and the milestones should be directed towards answering a key question on whether the research should progress further or a different path should be pursued.  Eligible applicants are full time faculty, staff, and researchers who have a CFOP account.",
        "A CTRI Review Committee will then review and select finalists from the pool of applicants. Finalists will be selected on the merits of their proposal.  Proposals for CTRI awards will be reviewed and ranked by a panel of faculty representatives of all major colleges from which proposals are received.  Depending on the level of funding, the highest ranking proposals will be awarded funding. The panel’s decision is final.",
