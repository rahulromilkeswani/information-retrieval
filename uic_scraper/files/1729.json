    "text": [
        "The UIC Honors College brings together a diverse group of exceptional undergraduate students, faculty, and staff, and provides an environment for advanced academic growth, creative engagement, and a foundation for lifelong learning in the world class city of Chicago.",
        "By providing an innovative curriculum and promoting engagement with faculty and the resources of UIC, the Honors College will stand out among its peers by preparing global leaders able to shape a just society in the 21st century.",
        "",
        "All members of the Honors College also belong to a degree-granting college such as Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) or Engineering. Those students participating in web-based programs, however, are not eligible for participation at present. Members of the Honors College are expected to take honors courses and/or participate in an array of experiences beyond the classroom each semester.",
        "Essential benefits of being a member of the Honors College include:",
        "Honors courses are small in size and taught by top professors on campus, providing students the opportunity to interact with UIC’s finest scholars. Hundreds of UIC faculty members volunteer each year to work with Honors students because they enjoy working with motivated and talented students. Our students are recognized on campus as leaders, innovators and contributors to the UIC community and the city at large. Please download our fact flyer for more information on demographics, enrollment statistics, and more."
