        "The Counseling Center offers a comprehensive range of clinical functions to the university community. The most prominent are assessment and personal counseling for students, in the form of intake interviews, individual and couples psychotherapy, group therapy, case management, systems interventions and advocacy, and crisis or walk-in services. The Clinical Staff also provide outreach and psycho-educational programming, teaching, consultation to individuals and other units within the university, participation on university committees, and referral to specialized mental health services elsewhere on or off campus.",
        "Our services are available to students who are eligible, currently-enrolled or continuing students whose concerns fall within our Scope of Practice (see Scope of Services). Continuing student status includes individuals who are taking a semester off and planning to return the following semester, those who are continuing counseling during the period between semesters, those who enrolled and then withdrew or were dropped within the same semester, and those who are on an authorized leave of absence. Non-students may participate in couples counseling as a partner of an enrolled UIC student.",
        "To make an appointment at the Counseling Center, simply telephone (312-996-3490) or walk-in and speak to the receptionist to schedule a specific time for an initial appointment. If it is an emergency, please be sure to let us know.",
        "We do our best to meet with you as soon as possible and accommodate your schedule, availability for the first appointment can vary across the year. Most people are offered an available initial consultation to be seen within several days of your request. The receptionist will speak with you about the reasons you are seeking assistance, and will schedule you with an appropriate counselor.",
        "If you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency, call 911 or go to your local emergency room. (UIC Hospital ER is located at 1740 W Taylor Street, Suite 1600, Chicago, IL 60612.)",
        "Those students who present to the Counseling Center in acute need during the hours the Center is open are provided immediate services within the constraints of staff availability, or are provided with appropriate referrals. When the Center is not open, you can still call the Counseling Center and press “2” to speak with the After Hours Crisis Counselor on call, or go to the nearest hospital Emergency Room. See our Crisis Services page for additional information and resources.",
        "The first thing you will be asked to do when you arrive is to complete preliminary information forms using a computer in our reception area. (If you are not able to use the computer, alternate means to complete these forms can be provided.) These forms ask about demographic and contact information and include a questionnaire that gives us an idea of your most pressing concerns. You will also be asked to read and sign forms that explain our confidentiality policy and your rights and responsibilities in counseling. In order to ensure that there is enough time to complete this process, we ask that you arrive approximately 30 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time. After you have completed all forms, this information goes to the receptionist, who will make them available to your scheduled counselor to review before your session.",
        "After reviewing your completed paperwork, a counselor will meet you in the waiting room and walk with you to their office to speak in private. The purpose of the first session at the Counseling Center is to assess your concerns and to develop a plan of how to address those concerns. The session can also be used to begin to address any urgent issues. During your meeting with the counselor, you will have a chance to describe why you are seeking assistance and why you have chosen this particular time to do so. The counselor will explain and answer your questions about the counseling process. They will ask for information about your present situation, your family background, general health and self-care, and important relationships in your life. You may be asked to discuss past experiences with this or similar problems and how you have tried to solve them.",
        "Some students find that talking with a counselor once is sufficient to resolve the immediate concern. If further services would be beneficial, these will be discussed, and a recommendation will be made by the counselor. These additional services may include resources offered by the Counseling Center or referral to another campus or community resource.",
        "The Counseling Center is supported by the Health Service Fee as already assessed to students enrolled at the university. Enrolled students are therefore eligible for Counseling Center mental health services without additional cost.",
        "We adhere fully to applicable professional, legal and ethical standards. Information you provide in the course of counseling is held as confidential within the Center. We will not release information about you to anyone outside the Center nor to your academic record unless we have your signed consent specifically authorizing disclosure, with the following limited exceptions: instances of imminent risk of harm to yourself or others, mandated reporting of current child or elder abuse, or a court order and legal subpoena. The exceptions are rare, and your counselor generally will discuss the decision with you and seek your consent before such action is taken. If you have designated an Emergency Mental Health Contact person, we are obligated by law to contact that person within 24 hours if you are assessed as being at imminent risk. Please know that you may rescind, change, or add an Emergency Mental Health Contact person by logging into your UIC student portal at my.UIC.edu.",
        "We cannot release any information about you to another party without your written consent except in the specific situations described above.",
        "No. Counseling Center records are kept completely separate from academic records. In those circumstances where a student chooses to reveal they are a recipient of mental health services (e.g. as a factor in obtaining academic accommodation, withdrawal from UIC, or re-instatement at UIC) this information may become part of a student’s academic record.",
        "No. Counseling Center records are kept completely separate from medical records. If you have lab tests at Family Medicine (sometimes a requirement when taking certain psychiatrically prescribed medications) there may be a notation that you are seeing a psychiatrist at the Counseling Center. In those circumstances where a student chooses to reveal they are a recipient of mental health services as a factor in obtaining medical treatment, this information may become part of a student’s medical record.",
        "One of the services the Counseling Center provides is assisting students in connecting with services in the community by referral, when appropriate. This can be especially helpful if you are looking for longer term counseling or are considering leaving or taking some time off from the university before you would be finished with counseling. We have a variety of providers to choose from who work regularly with UIC students, including some with sliding fee scales.",
        "We have a psychiatrist on staff who can prescribe medication to students who are in ongoing therapy at the center. If you are already taking medication and are looking to transfer your care to UIC without entering therapy, we can assist you with referral options on campus or in the community. See the description of Integrative Psychiatry Services (internal link) for more details.",
        "If your concerns are interpersonal in nature, group therapy might be the right fit for you. In a therapy group, six to eight people meet face-to-face with two trained group therapists and talk about what is troubling them. Members give feedback to each other by expressing their own feelings about what someone says or does. This interaction gives group members an opportunity to experiment with new ways of behaving and to learn more about the way they interact with others. What makes the situation unique is that it is a safe system. The content of the group sessions is confidential; what members talk about or disclose is not to be discussed outside the group. Members work to establish a level of trust that allows them to talk personally and honestly. Group trust is enhanced when all members make a commitment to the group.",
        "When people come into a group and interact freely with other group members, they usually recreate those difficulties that brought them to group therapy in the first place. Under the skilled direction of the group therapists, the group is able to give support, offer alternatives, or gently confront one another. In this way, members’ difficulties become resolved, alternative behaviors are learned, and members develop new social techniques or ways of relating to people. During group therapy, people begin to see that they are not alone. Many people feel they are unique because of their problems, and it is encouraging to hear that other people have similar difficulties."
