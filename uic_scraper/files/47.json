        "We strongly encourage UIC CS students to sign up for hackathon competitions. Here are some reasons why:",
        "UIC students have placed highly in these hackathon events:",
        "Research experiences for undergraduates—called REUs for short—offer undergraduate students the opportunity to complete career-building research projects over the summer. REUs are competitive (with students chosen for the research positions by application) and often are held at universities other than your home institution. They are sponsored with funding from the National Science Foundation and typically come with a stipend that you can use to cover living expenses and other costs.",
        "REUs make excellent résumé entries and offer valuable hands-on experience that you can talk about in job interviews. If you have your eye on a master’s degree or PhD after graduation, REUs provide a head start on building your research experience and could give you insight on what you might like to pursue in graduate school.",
        "Think of REUs as a great way to get research experience while trying out living in a different place.",
        "Select current REUs (use the search function below to find more):",
        "The deadlines for these 2020 REUs have passed, but we are leaving them listed here in case you want to reach out to the sponsoring organizations to ask whether there is still an opportunity to apply."
