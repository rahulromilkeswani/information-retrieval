        "Chemical Engineer and South Carolina educator Michael D. Amiridis was named UIC chancellor/vice president. Before serving as the executive vice president for academic affairs and provost at the University of South Carolina, Amiridis was the dean of South Carolina’s College of Engineering and Computing from 2006 to 2009, and served as the chair of the Department of Chemical Engineering from 2002 to 2006. Amiridis earned his undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki in Greece, and his PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. His research interests focus on the synthesis and catalytic characterization of bimetallic nanoparticles with controlled composition and architecture. He has won several awards for his academic work including the NSF-CAREER Award, Golden Key Award for Integration of Undergraduate Teaching and Research, and the USC College of Engineering Research Achievement Award in 2005."
