We’ve put technology in the hands of more people than ever before. Now we must overcome the usability challenges that have emerged and mine the data that technology is producing.",
        "UIC’s PhD in biomedical and health informatics (BHI) prepares future academicians and healthcare industry leaders. You will join those who are advancing new ideas to enable complex decision-making and promote health information technology.",
        "We focus on research, scholarship and interprofessionality, working in teams that include a range of professions and settings. Our curriculum prepares you to solve today’s complex knowledge management issues—and ensure that these solutions are effective for the healthcare professionals who use them.",
        "Our program is structured to be delivered face-to-face, full-time, using an extensive mentorship model. It is contemporary in terms of technology-based learning, with a small number of courses delivered online or in a blended model.",
        "US News & World Report: Education recently noted the high demand for specialists in health informatics. Career opportunities abound in industry and academia. Chicago is an international center of health care and biomedical research, with seven medical colleges and over 50 hospitals located in the area. Many major U.S. health information technology firms invest in research and development in this highly competitive industry.",
        "Job titles include:",
        "The dramatic rise in the number of health informatics degree programs at universities nationwide means an increased demand for faculty trained at the doctoral level.",
