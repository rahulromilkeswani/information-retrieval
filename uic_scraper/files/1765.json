        "Honors College Fellows come from departments in all colleges across the UIC campus; a list of Honors College Fellows is available here. These faculty members apply for appointment as Fellows to have the opportunity to work with high-achieving undergraduates and to help such students perform at their highest level of ability. Busy both as scholars and as teachers, the Fellows of the Honors College deserve thanks from the entire UIC community for their support of Honors College students, which leads students to success at UIC and beyond. The Honors College welcomes applications from faculty interested in becoming Fellows.",
        "Honors College students are assigned to a Fellow at the start of the sophomore year or at the time of transfer to UIC. Current students can find more information about their assigned fellow through the Honors Activity Reporting System.",
        "To effectively cultivate the Fellow-Student relationship, the Fellow and student should meet face-to-face in the first two weeks of the semester to discuss the student’s Honors Activity, and the Fellow will indicate his or her approval by signing the Honors Activity Agreement Form. As a way of strengthening the Fellow-Student relationship, Fellows are strongly urged to meet a second time during the term with each of their Honors advisees — perhaps during departmental advising for the following term, or perhaps at a time when both Fellow and student can get to know each other better.",
        "As an Honors advisor, the Fellow:",
        "As a mentor in a more general sense, the Fellow:"
