        "The General Education Program at UIC is designed to serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. It also helps prepare students for the world beyond the college experience, a world in which one needs to be able to:",
        "The General Education Program at UIC (sometimes referred to as Gen Ed or GE) has two main components: a grouping of core courses that are clustered around six themes and sets of required proficiencies. The specific requirements vary from college to college. All colleges, however, require a minimum of 24 semester hours of credit with at least one course in each of the six categories of General Education and proficiency in writing (as demonstrated by successful completion of ENGL 160 and ENGL 161 or by certain scores on placement or other tests). Note: Students may count up to two courses in their major toward their General Education requirements. If students have a double major, then two courses from each of the majors may be applied toward General Education.",
        "The General Education Core includes the following six categories. This section of the catalog provides a description and list of courses for each category.",
        "The University Writing requirement is common across all colleges. Individual colleges may have additional General Education requirements and proficiencies. Students should consult their college and department sections of the catalog for information about fulfilling the General Education requirements as a required part of their degree program.",
        "Students must demonstrate proficiency in written English by earning passing grades in ENGL 160 and ENGL 161, or by achieving proficiency (see section on Demonstrating Writing Proficiency for a Waiver of ENGL 160 or ENGL 161",
        ") in one or both of these courses certified in writing by the Department of English. The Department of English reserves the right to require a student to take a preparatory course as a prerequisite for ENGL 160 if the student’s score on the Writing Placement Test reveals the need for such a course. Whenever questions arise with regard to the fulfillment of the University Writing requirement through transfer courses, a writing portfolio, or standard examinations, the Department of English will determine whether to grant the student an exemption from the requirement.",
        "Students should consult their college section of the catalog for more information on fulfilling the University Writing requirement as part of their degree program.",
        "A central principle of a knowledge-based society is that, where possible, experimental tests should be designed to critically evaluate the accuracy of an idea or physical law. It is crucial that students understand both how accurate experimental results are obtained and how uncertainties in these results affect scientific conclusions. Courses in this category provide an understanding of scientific method and the factual knowledge necessary to develop hypotheses, to test them, and to distinguish those conclusions resting on unsupported assertion from those verified by sound scientific reasoning. Theories also play an important role in the way we see the world around us. In the natural sciences, theories are developed to explain experimental observation, form the basis for the design of further experiments, and provide the foundation for advances in technology. Mathematics provides appropriate tools (such as calculus) necessary to formulate the scientific theories.",

The objects of study in these courses include the human past and its historical record; the emergence and transformation of nations, states, ideas, and civilizations; traditions and modes of human thought; the relationship between ideas and practices; and the implications of scientific discovery and technological innovation.",

Courses fulfilling this requirement acquaint students with issues involved in making, interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating written texts, musical works, visual and material culture, performing arts, and other media presentations in the context of the histories and cultures that have shaped and been shaped by their production.

Courses in this category explore how cultures function and how they may arise and change, whether through the internationalization of economies, social or political forces, changes in environment, or the development of new technologies. Further, these courses aim to provide students with the necessary tools to study and evaluate disparate social systems and cultural products.",

The goal is thus to understand our society and our political and economic systems, whether to gain knowledge of the past events that have shaped current ones, to gain the means to evaluate critically current policy and to shape future ones, or to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of our current communities.",
