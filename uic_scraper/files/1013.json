        "The Leadership & Service Expo is an opportunity for the UIC community to explore avenues to serve Chicago. Community agencies and organizations come to campus to recruit volunteers and interns and share their missions. A wide variety of agencies are represented, focused on youth, the environment, the arts, animals, human rights, community development, health, and more. Students, faculty, and staff can find service and volunteer opportunities that match their interests, learn about the needs of Chicago-area communities, and find ways to get involved."
