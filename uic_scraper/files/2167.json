    "text": [
        "Civil Engineering, PhD ’19 | Iran",
        "How do you hope your research will create positive change in the world? I hope my research will help to reduce the issue of hypoxia, a condition in the Gulf of Mexico where water near the bottom of the Gulf contains less than two parts per million of dissolved oxygen.",
        "Dissertation title: The Impact of Wetland Biogeochemistry and Hydraulic Loading on Tile Drainage Nutrient Removal Efficiency",
        "Place you’re most likely to be found on campus: Student Center East balcony.",

        "Materials Engineering, PhD ’22 | Burlington, New Jersey",
        "What is your academic focus within your department? My current academic focus involves the use of pulsed laser deposition to grow complex oxide thin films with interesting magnetic and electric properties.",
        "How do you hope your research will create positive change in the world? Though I have hopes that my work will contribute to a greater understanding of the effects that strain and stoichiometry have on the interesting physical properties of oxide materials, I also hope that by doing my work, I am able to demonstrate to my community that people who look like me are more than capable of conducting research and contributing to science’s multitudinous branches. Paying it forward to future Black graduate students will be at the forefront of my contribution to a positive change in the world.",
        "How (and why) did you choose your faculty advisor? I chose Dr. Jeremiah T. Abiade as my faculty advisor because I found his preferred experimental techniques and focus area fascinating. I felt that he would be well-suited to facilitating my growth as both a young scholar and a future faculty member.",
        "What has been the most rewarding part of doing research at UIC? The most rewarding part of doing research at UIC has been learning a variety of experimental techniques relevant to my work using the institution’s facilities, and recovering from failures with a greater understanding of problems encountered in research.",
        "Civil Engineering, PhD ’20 | India",
        "What is your academic focus within your department? Geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering and computational geotechnics.",
        "What has been the most rewarding part of doing research at UIC? The highly collaborative setting that aids in bringing together the expertise from different disciplines to work on a common problem is quite enriching. It is one of the most rewarding parts of doing research at UIC.",
        "How do you hope your research will create positive change in the world? The results from my research will enable landfill owners, operators, and landfill design professionals to predict the holistic performance of a landfill system and provide recommendations for effective and safe design and operation of landfill systems. Overall, I strongly believe my research will aid in solving some of the pressing problems of managing waste in a sustainable way and eventually contribute toward achieving global sustainable development goals.",
        "Place you’re most likely to be found on campus: SEL West, the location of my lab; ERF, because I use computer lab quite often; SCE, where I often eat; and The Quad, where I get some fresh air and enjoy watching different people doing their stuff.",
        "Civil Engineering, PhD ’22 | Nepal",
        "What is your academic focus within your department? Geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering.",
        "How do you hope your research will create positive change in the world? Since I am working on creating a zero emission landfill cover, I hope my research will have a great impact on creating a cleaner environment.",
        "How (and why) did you choose your faculty advisor? I was interested in my Professor Krishna Reddy‘s research field, and, luckily, the professor I was working with during my master’s research knew him and recommended me to him.",
        "Favorite place in Chicago: North Avenue Beach.",
        "",
        "Civil Engineering, MS ’20 | Pakistan",
        "Name one thing you think UIC does better than anywhere else: Diversity in both students and faculty.",
        "How (and why) did you choose your faculty advisor? I chose Dr. Mohsen Issa because he is one of the finest professors in the department.",
        "What do you hope to be doing 10 years from now? Running my own structural engineering company.",
        "",
        "Civil Engineering, MS ’20 | Belarus",
        "Name one thing you think UIC does better than anywhere else: Diversity and inclusion.",
        "What is your academic focus within your department? Water resources and environmental engineering.",
        "How (and why) did you choose your faculty advisor? I met my advisor, Dr. Amid Khodadoust, on the day when I came to UIC to check out its master’s degree program. After I talked to him, I decided that I wanted to be a part of UIC and enrolled in the program.",
        "Place you’re most likely to be found on campus: The Student Recreation Facility because I love sports.",
        "Favorite place in Chicago: Lake Michigan and the downtown area.",
        "Materials Engineering, PhD ’20 | India",
        "How do you hope your research will create positive change in the world? I feel my research will help in manufacturing better and resilient space age materials. Also, because nano material have found applications in the battery industry, it should help in achieving sustainability.",
        "What has been the most rewarding part of doing research at UIC? I have an invention report in my name for lithium oxygen batteries.",
        "Place you’re most likely to be found on campus: The Corrosion Lab in Science and Engineering South, which is where we perform metallography on manufactured samples.",
