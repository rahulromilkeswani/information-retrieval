        "Hello World! I’m Taha. I am a computer science PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I am being advised by Chris Kanich. I also collaborate with Blase Ur from the University of Chicago and Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez from ICSI, Berkeley. Before joining UIC in 2015, I completed my BS in electrical engineering from the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Pakistan.",
        "My research interests are broadly in the areas of security, privacy and human-computer interaction (HCI). I specifically use data-driven methods to understand human factors in security and to create systems which improve the overall security and usability of the Internet. Recently, I have developed an interest in cognitive science and computer science education research and I plan to extend my future work in these domains.",
