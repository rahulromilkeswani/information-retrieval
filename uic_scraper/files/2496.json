    "title": "Annual Assessment of Doctoral Students | Graduate College | University of Illinois at Chicago",
    "text": [
        "Effective Fall 2013 the Graduate College requires doctoral programs to conduct an annual assessment of their doctoral students.",
        "An analysis of assessments in programs reveals some commonality mixed with program specific assessment items. It is clear that “one size does not fit all.” For example, in some disciplines (e.g., the STEM disciplines), doctorate students may only have an adviser after two (or more) years due to other requirements such as course work. Further, admission to doctorate candidacy (passing the Ph.D. Preliminary Exam) occurs at different times in different disciplines. For uniformity and the sake of good practice, the policy requires annual assessment of all doctoral students. In addition, care has been taken to ensure that the policy guards against potential conflicts of interest by requiring that the assessment of doctoral students contains an independent element.",
        "Programs must conduct annual academic progress reviews for all enrolled doctoral students at least once every academic year, beginning in the students’ first year. Students who are registered under a doctoral program code are considered doctoral students for the purpose of this policy.  Annual assessments are encouraged, though not required, for master’s students.",
        "All annual assessments should include:",
        "The requirements listed above represent minimum actions, and programs may further develop reviews to incorporate additional items.",
        "The policy was effective for the Academic Year 2013-14, for all registered doctoral students.",
        "Note:  These examples are meant as information and guidance, and may not, individually, contain all elements required of the UIC Graduate College policy.  This is true even for the examples from UIC programs.  In addition, the programs represented may have changed the forms/processes represented since they were collected.",
        "[Examples from other institutions, as well as UIC examples updated to reflect the new assessment policy will be added. Check back for updates.]",
        "During the Spring Semester 2011, the Graduate College surveyed doctoral students and Directors of Graduate Studies (DGS) about current annual assessment practices in their programs. There were several motivations for conducting this survey, including continued issues related to the mentor/student relationship.  The results of a similar UIUC survey2showed a lack of agreement between students and DGSs as to whether certain programs were conducting annual reviews.  In a focus group the Graduate College held on assessment after the survey was completed, and in various recent discussions, students clearly and explicitly indicated a lack of clarity in regards to expectations within their programs, and a desire for early and annual assessments.",
        "The following are results from the UIC survey and resultant focus group that informed a recommendation to institute an annual assessment policy:",
        "1.  From the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Graduate College website:",
        "1Appoved at the Graduate College Executive Committee meeting, January 27, 2012.",
        "2The Graduate College at UIUC provided the survey to UIC and the Graduate College at UIC made minor modifications. UIC’s Graduate College would like to acknowledge and thank UIUC’s Graduate College for aiding with this policy and process."
