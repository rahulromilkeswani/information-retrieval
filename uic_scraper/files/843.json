        "He always talked about it. And then, when it came to fruition, with the protestors, it was very controversial, with the march around the house, and all that they said about my dad. It was hard. But he knew in his heart that that was good, because he loved education so much. He went to night school. He didn’t have it easy. In those days, that’s what they did. And they worked very hard.",

        "He’d drive past when it was first under construction. I think it was based on his experience, how long it took to get his college degree, how long it took to get his law degree, and the expense of it. He was fortunate. He was an only child. His father worked. I think he saw the hardships that it brought on a lot of other students. He felt that the city and the state should put a major campus here in the city. And it had to be located somewhere where there was the best sources of public transportation. That was always his issue. Building it in the boondocks, where you had to have a car, would exclude so many kids. It had to have good access to public transportation.",
