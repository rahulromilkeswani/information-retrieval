        "Your application, application fee, academic credentials and any additional materials required by your program must be received by the deadline stated.",
        "Deadlines are subject to change – it is advisable to apply early.  Deadlines may change without notice and some programs will close before the stated deadline due to the large volume of applications they may receive, or other factors. It is to your advantage to apply well before the deadline. Applications and materials received after the deadlines will not be considered. Note that international applicants often have earlier deadlines than domestic applicants.",
        "Check Graduate Application Deadlines below for programs where the nondegree deadline is earlier or has term restrictions. If specifically not listed than the general nondegree deadlines apply. (Note:  Some programs do not admit program-specific nondegree students, and the program name will not be listed on the Graduate Nondegree Application.  If there is a quesion, contact the program directly.)",
