        "The Center for Urban Economic Development (CUED) conducts research, policy analysis, and evaluation on urban and regional economic and workforce development issues, programs, and strategies. Our work is based on the view that urban and regional economies can develop in ways that create broadly shared prosperity-that they can become simultaneously more productive, more innovative, and more equitable. We collaborate with other researchers and with stakeholders at government agencies at all levels, foundations, economic and workforce development organizations, businesses, labor organizations, and civic organizations. We help public and private sector leaders understand the economic impacts of existing and proposed policies and strategies and assist them in formulating new policies and strategies. We work in metropolitan areas throughout the United States and beyond, with a special emphasis on metropolitan Chicago.",
        "Established in 1978, CUED is a unit of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago and is affiliated with Great Cities Institute.",
        "CUED is a member of the Economic Analysis and Research Network (EARN), a network of state and regional research, policy, and advocacy organizations. EARN is coordinated by the Economic Policy Institute.",
