        "UIC is deeply committed to fostering an inclusive environment for students of diverse backgrounds including undocumented students. We take seriously our public mission and land-grant commitment to not only expand educational pathways for undocumented students, but also to ensure that they have high-quality educational experiences. The Office of Diversity promotes greater awareness and understanding of undocumented students’ experiences (while maintaining the confidentiality of individuals) and develops campus responses and processes to address their needs related to academic success.",
        "For students who are undocumented or from mixed immigration status families, we have a range of resources and services to help. For instance, UIC Dream provides information to current and prospective students and their families regarding residency for in-state tuition and enrollment.",
        "Don’t see what you need there? The Office of Diversity’s Associate Director for Equity and Inclusion, Tanya Cabrera, is available to provide individualized support to undocumented students focused on academic assistance, financial aid, legal assistance, and utilization of an integrative campus and community referral network. Her focus is ensuring that undocumented students are informed about the resources and programs available to them at UIC, in the city of Chicago, and in the State of Illinois.",
