        "Below is a list of questions that the computer science department typically receives from applicants to our master’s and PhD programs. Do you have a question that is not on this list? Email us at ask.csgrad@cs.uic.edu.",
        "We ask all applicants to review the admission requirements listed on our website. Due to the large number of requests we receive, we do not pre-screen applicants for admission eligibility. Use your discretion when deciding to apply.",
        "Our admissions committee reviews all complete applications, regardless of whether all criteria are met. No matter what, the committee evaluates each person’s overall academic record and all materials submitted to make a final decision. Admission is not guaranteed if all requirements are met, neither do we guarantee denial if you do not meet all the criteria.",
        "All computer science graduate applicants are automatically considered for funding. Funding may come in the form of fellowships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, or tuition and fee waivers. Separate applications are not required. Visit our financial aid and funding page for more information.",
        "The GRE is not required for MS applicants with a degree earned in the United States. It is, however, recommended. All other applicants must submit official GRE scores.",
        "For the purposes of application review, only a PDF copy of the credentials should be submitted online. Official, sealed credentials will be requested only from admitted applicants intending to enroll.",
        "Please see the Office of International Services website for additional details, and contact them with inquiries about OIS document requests or financial documents you’ve submitted.",
        "You can monitor the status of your application on the admissions website. Application information only will be given to you, the applicant. If you have questions, contact ask.csgrad@uic.edu. Include your name, UIN, and date of birth. It may take up to 10 business days to receive a reply.",
        "If you are selected for a fellowship or teaching assistantship, you will be contacted by March for fall admissions. Please note that no fellowships are available for spring admissions. Only applicants who are offered aid are contacted.",
        "Please contact the Office of International Services for all matters related to forms and visas: ois.uic.edu."
