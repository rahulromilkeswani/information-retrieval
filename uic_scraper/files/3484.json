        "Students apply for admission to graduate programs in bioengineering and bioinformatics through the UIC Graduate College. Applications are considered individually by the admissions committee for graduate programs.",
        "Successful applicants to graduate study at UIC will have studied physical or life sciences, engineering, computer science, mathematics, biology, or pre-medicine as undergraduates. Upon entry into any graduate program in the Department of Bioengineering, students must have completed Calculus 1 through 3 (or equivalent), Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra.",
        "If you are considering master’s-level study at UIC, our MS programs overview booklet is a great place to begin. If you are interested in doctoral study, start here.",
        "Would you like to know more about our bioengineering/bioinformatics graduate programs? Please fill out the form linked below, and we will respond with information about your program of interest at UIC.",
        "Applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate College and the requirements of the bioengineering department. In general, applicants should be prepared with:",
        "For current deadlines, please see the Graduate College’s admissions deadlines page.",
        "Most PhD applicants already have earned (or are about to complete) an MS in bioengineering. However, exceptional applicants who seek to start the PhD with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.”  Students who are admitted to the PhD program with only a bachelor’s degree in bioengineering or a related field must complete at least 48 hours of coursework for the PhD, of which 24 semester hours must be bioengineering courses and of which at least 20 hours must be at the 500 level, excluding BIOE 595, BIOE 596, and BIOE 599. A maximum of 4 hours of BIOE 590 may be applied toward the degree.",
        "UIC bioengineering also participates in the prestigious NIH-supported Medical Scientist Training Program, a competitive MD/PhD track providing seven years of funding support in collaboration with the UIC College of Medicine, home of the largest medical school in the United States. Visit the program website for full information on this dual-degree program.",
