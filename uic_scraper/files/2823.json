        "First off, it’s ok to not be ok! Mental illness is an illness just like any other. If you have the flu, you go to the doctor, you rest, you take care of yourself…So why is this so hard when we experience depression or anxiety? Sadly, there is a lot of stigma surrounding mental health and mental health treatment. But just like any other illness, it is important to take care of yourself. Don’t worry what others think or say, your top priority needs to be taking care of yourself. Never forget, your feelings and emotions are important and they are valid. The things you are feeling are very real and not “all in your head.” Mental illness is an illness and everyone deserves help and treatment.",
        "If you’re nervous or unsure of where to start, do some research! Whether you’re looking for treatment options or just want to educate yourself, there are so many resources right at your fingertips. If you are looking for resources within the UIC community, you can visit the UIC Counseling Center in the Student Services Building (SSB) in suite 2010 or check out their website at https://counseling.uic.edu/.",

        "If you’re looking for resources throughout Chicago (or the suburbs!) you can check out the National Alliance on Mental Illness, or NAMI, at https://www.namichicago.org/",
        "If you’re looking for educational or advocacy information look at Hope for the Day at https://www.hftd.org/",
        "If you have a friend or loved one that experiences mental health issues, try to be understanding and supportive! Educate yourself and try to share your resources with them.",
        "College is one of the most stressful things that you will ever experience! If you ever doubt yourself, remember this: you are strong, you are capable, the stress of college is only temporary, and you will be successful!",
