        "We offer six different programs in the Department of Biomedical and Health Information Sciences that produce experts in creating health-related information and transforming it into applicable knowledge.",
        "Our students are highly regarded and highly respected. They work with faculty members who are leaders in their fields and passionate about teaching. If you want to be a leader in the healthcare industry, you’re in the right place. Apply now!",
        "Tuition is determined by the University of Illinois at Chicago, and does change every now and then. You can always see the most up-to-date information on the admissions website.",
        "Funding your education can be complex, but we believe money shouldn’t be a barrier to reaching your goals. We’re committed to making college affordable by guiding you through the financial aid process.",
        "Loans, grants, scholarships and student jobs can make college more affordable and accessible. Familiarize yourself with the options available to you, and contact us when you need help.",
        "Some courses in the programs offered in the Department of Biomedical and Health Information Sciences require proctored exams. As a convenience to students, the department offers an online proctoring service for a nominal fee.",
        "Payment of this fee is the obligation of the individual examinees. Payment is made with a credit or debit card via a secure page connected to a third party card processor. Proctoring fees are based on the length of the exam and when it is scheduled. A typical 1-2 hr exam has a fee of $25.00. A part-time student (enrolled in two courses per semester) can expect to spend about $50 per semester, while a typical full-time student (enrolled in five courses) can expect to spend about $125 per semester. In addition, students pay the proctoring fee if they desire to take proficiency tests. Note that the exact amount paid for proctoring fees will vary by student over time.",
        "Use of the proctoring service requires technology that is typical for online students. ProctorU has published minimum and recommended technical requirements.",
        "Students have the option to secure an alternative proctor if acceptable to the instructor.",
        "A library/IT fee will be assessed at the rate of $18 per credit hour and covers the following services: use of online Library and IT services such as Blackboard, UIC e-mail, software licenses, technology security, published works and periodicals through the Library database and others.",
        "Students in good standing who demonstrate financial need are eligible for the Van Doren Scholarship.",
        "The W.E. Van Doren Scholarship Fund provides income for scholarship in the field of medicine and related healing arts. Applications are accepted in the fall and spring terms.",
        "Understanding the financial process can be overwhelming, but we’re here for you. Reach out when you need help and we’ll make sure you get the answers you need.",
