        "If something can be switched on, an electrical engineer likely had a hand in its development. Electrical engineers hold the keys to the operation of the vast majority of the devices we use in our everyday lives. A degree in electrical engineering from UIC will give you the knowledge and skills you need to join their ranks.",
        "Electrical engineering is always extending its boundaries into new areas of technology. Electrical engineers are developing the technology needed to power electric cars far beyond the range of today’s batteries and charging stations. They are working on nanoscale devices that have the potential to reshape medical diagnosis and treatment. Electrical engineering is helping us to be more energy-efficient and exploring ways to make renewable energy useful to a greater proportion of the world’s population.",
        "What about electrical engineering excites you? Perhaps you want to help create the robots that will be powered by the next generation of artificial intelligence. Maybe you will develop a way that puts wind energy onto the grid in a more efficient way. Or you could be part of a team that determines what 6G wireless will be like and when we will get it.",
        "Full degree requirements for the electrical engineering major are in the UIC course catalog, but the overview below provides a sense of what’s ahead in EE.",
        "Electrical engineering majors complete coursework in three categories:",
        "The ECE department has identified groups of courses that can help guide your academic planning based on the areas of electrical and computer engineering in which you seek to specialize. You can find descriptions of each track and its associated courses on this page.",
        "As part of our accreditation process, ABET asks our department to capture the overall goals of the electrical and computer engineering programs. These are called our educational program objectives. Within a few years of graduation, our talented graduates will:",
        "Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires the department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes.",
        "Students graduating from the electrical engineering, computer engineering, and engineering physics programs at UIC will have:",
        "In the 2019-2020 academic year, 371 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as electrical engineering majors across all class years. The department graduated 97 electrical engineering majors in the academic year ending May 2019."
