        "The Civil Engineering Professional Advisory Council, or CEPAC, enhances the undergraduate experience in civil engineering by creating connections for UIC students in the professional community, providing an industry perspective on the curriculum, and participating actively in student projects and activities.",
        "Established in 2000, CEPAC draws its membership from both professional practitioners—many of whom are UIC alumni—and civil engineering faculty members. Its ranks include leaders in the environmental, geotechnical, structures, transportation, and water resources fields and represent private companies and government agencies throughout the Chicago region.",
        "UIC alumni are denoted with an asterisk."
