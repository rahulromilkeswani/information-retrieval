        "Counseling Center staff members provide presentations, workshops, and consultation to students, faculty, and staff at UIC.",
        "Counseling Center staff are available to answer questions and provide support for specific departments on campus. For a list of liaison relationships, click here.",
        "Let’s Talk is a consultation service provided to UIC students outside of the Counseling Center. Click here to learn more.",
        "The Counseling Center provides presentations and workshops that focus on activities that increase individual, interpersonal, and professional development. Most programs address both knowledge and skills, and some include experiential or interactive components. During the year, we initiate a number of programs, often in collaboration with other UIC organizations. In addition, we frequently receive and respond to requests to develop programs for classes, student organizations, faculty or staff groups, and other UIC units. We always include activities individually tailored to the needs of the particular organization.",
        "Our staff can develop programs addressing a variety of other topics. We can also suggest other resources at UIC for topics outside our expertise.",
        "Scheduled programs are often listed on our Upcoming Workshops and Events page or the UIC Events Calendar. The UIC News and the Chicago Flame also often carry information about our programs. Flyers and posters regarding upcoming programs are available in the Counseling Center Suite (Student Services Building #2010). Many are also posted throughout campus.",
        "If you are interested in a having the Counseling Center provide a workshop or program, please complete the Outreach/Presentation Request form and submit it to our Assistant Director for Outreach, Dr. Johanna Strokoff, via email (jstrokof@uic.edu) or fax [(312) 996-7645]. Dr. Strokoff will review your request and contact you, typically within 3-5 days of your initial request.",
        "While we will make every effort to meet requests, certain peak times of the year do not allow us the time or resources to do outreach programs. Ultimately, it is best if you give us at least two to four weeks notice for a presentation and that you can assure that at least 10 participants will attend.",
        "If we are unable to meet your need, we will suggest other resources to you or discuss another time of the year when we might be more available to meet your needs."
