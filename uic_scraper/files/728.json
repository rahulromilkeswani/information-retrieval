I did just one medium-intermidiate level session in the Spring, which was enough for me to start taking undergraduate classes at a community college in the Fall of the same year. I learned so much in a very short time. Excellent English program as I am now a nurse and in grad school :). I am very proud to say that I went to one of the best ESL classes in Chicago. I would definitely recommend it”",
