    "title": "Summer Research Opportunities Program for Undergraduates | Graduate College | University of Illinois at Chicago",
    "text": [
        "The Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) was first established in 1986 by the Graduate Deans of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC). The goal of SROP is to introduce domestic underrepresented sophomores and juniors to academic research experiences. Student participants work one-on-one with a faculty mentor giving them an opportunity to experience research and the graduate student experience. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) launched its SROP in 1986, with a total of six minority undergraduate students.",
        "As UIC approaches 35 years of hosting this program, SROP has over one thousand student participants. The success of SROP has been truly phenomenal. The retention, graduation, and post-baccalaureate rates of SROP students are substantially higher than those of the general student population. More than two-thirds of the SROP alumni have gone on to graduate and professional schools, which is four times the national average for all baccalaureates in the U.S.",
        "UIC’s numbers are equally impressive. At last count, 97% of those students who participated in its program have continued their studies or have earned a BA/BS degree, 47% are working toward or have completed a graduate degree, and 21.2% are working toward or have completed a professional degree. Our diverse student body, Research Extensive standing and location in the heart of downtown Chicago provide for an exceptional summer research experience.",
        "In the Fall semester, the Graduate College invites undergraduates to apply for participation in SROP. The student may apply to the program already having a research project in mind and a committed faculty mentor or simply by having a research area of interest. In cases where a student has an experienced interest but no mentor, the SROP staff will try to facilitate a match. The SROP Staff and faculty advisory committee are responsible for the selection process, the allocation of funding, and the evaluation of the program.",
        "In addition to working one-on-one with a faculty member, scholars participate in the following programmatic components:",
        "Please note:  Due to the 30-40 hour per week obligation to research activities, students who participate in SROP should view this program as a “full-time” experience. Holding additional internships, outside employment, or taking courses of any kind during SROP is strictly prohibited.",
        "What are the dates of the program?",
        "The SROP is an eight week program that begins May 28th, 2020 and concludes July 31st, 2020.",
        "How do I apply to the program?",
        "The application deadline is February 7, 2020. There is no application fee.",
        "Who is eligible to participate in SROP?",
        "Traditionally sophomores and juniors from historically underrepresented ethnic minority groups who have a 3.75 (on a 5.0 scale) or  2.75 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher grade point average are invited to apply. Applicants must be U.S. citizens of permanent residents.",
        "What are the benefits of the program?",
        "Students receive an award of up to $4,000 to work with talented faculty at a Research I institution with state-of-the-art facilities. That experience includes instruction in research development which prepares students for the demands of graduate study. They also learn how to apply for admissions and financial support for graduate school. In addition, SROP students are offered opportunities to present their research projects twice during the summer calendar.",
        "What about housing/board and travel?",
        "The program covers the cost of travel (up to $350) and housing for students who do not live in Chicago or the surrounding suburbs."
