    "text": [
        "Where can your graduate education lead you? Our graduates—more than 170 master’s alumni and 73 PhD alumni in the last five years—show that a degree from the Richard and Loan Hill Department of Bioengineering positions students for highly compensated industry jobs, sought-after postdoctoral research positions, and tenure-track appointments at universities around the world.",
        "Postdoctoral Fellow – Western University Campus-Pomona, CA",
        "O2M Technologies is a device company developing oxygen imaging instruments for in vitro and in vivo measurements in tissue samples and in small animals. We use patented technology to generate 3D oxygen maps. Tissue oxygen maps obtained using our technology can be used to develop enhanced therapies. The examples include but not limited to: develop better artificial cell replacement devices, assist drug development, and probe vitality of artificial tissue grafts pre- and post-implantation, guide cancer radiation treatment, assess immunotherapy and chemotherapy outcomes.",
        "UIC graduate students in bioengineering and bioinformatics recently have moved on to:",
        "The Engineering Career Center (ECC) provides helpful resources specifically geared toward UIC College of Engineering students and alumni for successfully securing internships, co-ops and jobs.",
        "This monthly seminar series is a cross college program, supported by GEMS and UI College of Medicine. It is run by Dr. Philip Clifford, Ph.D. Associate Dean for Research, UIC College of Applied Health Sciences. Dr. Clifford has been an outspoken advocate of career and professional development for PhD scientists, and is coauthor of the widely acclaimed career website, myIDP.sciencecareers.org and an accompanying series of career planning articles in ScienceCareers. The series meets every third Thursday of each month to present a variety of career-development related topics.  To see topics and guests for past and future events in this series follow this link.",
        "This profession development program offered by the Graduate College incorporates seminars, workshops, and some courses into a cohesive certificate-granting program. Details about PSP can be found at this site.",
        "The IDP is a written list of goals that include those for the student’s research project, professional skill development and career planning. It is written and developed by the student and includes a timeline for progression towards goals. As such, it serves as a framework by which the student can discuss progress with mentor(s).  All BIOE students are expect to develop an IDP after their 2ndyear and discuss it with their advisor on an annual basis. The myIDP website should be used for development of the plan and to mediate discussion of the IDP with the students and advisor.",
        "The Versatile PhD, LLC is an online resource for graduate students and postdocs who may be interested in non-academic careers.  Founded and led by Dr. Paula Chambers, this online resource provides information for PhD students and postdocs in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM disciplines. The resource can be accessed through the UIC Graduate College at this site."
