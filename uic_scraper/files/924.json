        "SIG SysAdmin is the system administration special interest group, the Spring 2012 semester was the first time it opened up to have general meetings. It's continuing goal is the maintenance, improvement, and expansion of the ACM network and systems; this includes the several ACM workstation, servers, and networking equipment, website administration also usually falls under the duty of the ACM Sysadmins. SIG SysAdmin is primarily Linux focused, but those seeking to further their knowledge of Enterprise Windows systems are encouraged to do so. People of all knowledge levels are welcome and are encouraged to explore the ACM wiki and website in general for more information. UIC ACM membership is required to access the ACM systems",
