The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) subsequently clarified that this is true whether or not the student remains in the U.S. or leaves the U.S. and takes the classes from elsewhere. However, SEVP also stated that this temporary provision is only in effect for the duration of the emergency and is subject to change.",

Currently, if an F-1 student is absent from the U.S. for five months or more, they must apply for a new I-20 and F-1 visa in order to return and resume studies.

Students who are feeling ill or suspect that they could have coronavirus/COVID-19 should first call their in network provider, Family Medicine at (312) 996-2901, to speak with a medical professional.

        "Can international employees telecommute (work from home)?",
        "In most cases, yes, international employees may telecommute but we ask that departments provide OIS with the home address that will be used for work prior to the start. For H-1B and E-3 employees, it is critical that departments provide OIS with the home address being used for work prior to the start of telecommuting because a new DOL Labor Condition Application (LCA) may be required. Please contact OIS for guidance. No USCIS nor DOL action is required for TN and O-1 employees, however, this could change if telecommuting becomes a long-term need. Stay tuned. Individuals working at UIC on an OPT or STEM OPT authorization hosted by another school should reach out to that school for guidance on how to report changes in work location.",
        "Can an employer stop paying or “bench” an international employee due to a reduction in services needed?",
        "No, employers must continue to pay H-1B and E-3 employees their salary or wage as listed on the Labor Condition Application (LCA) even if the employee is in “non-productive status”, and employers must continue to pay TN and O-1 employees pursuant to the conditions of the petition previously approved by the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "What should the department do if an international employee wants to take an extended HR-approved unpaid leave in response to coronavirus/COVID-19?",
        "Please reach out to OIS for guidance. We will provide details on how to best manage the immigration record depending on length of the leave and whether or not the individual will remain in the U.S. or travel abroad. Contact OIS at (312) 996-3121 or ois@uic.edu.",
        "What should the department do if an international employee needs to make a material change to their position as a result of coronavirus/COVID-19?",
        "Materials changes to H-1B, E-3, O-1 and TN positions include full-time to part-time status, changes in title, and other material changes. These types of changes require OIS to file an amendment with USCIS. Additional monitoring of hours may be required. Please consult with an OIS Advisor to determine if a change to a position requires an amendment to be filed with the USCIS.",
        "What should a department do if an international resigns of their own accord as result of coronavirus/COVID-19?",
        "Please submit a Departure Verification Form (DVF) to OIS.",
        "",
        "",
        "How should departments advise international employees who are considering a trip abroad?",
        "First a foremost, international employees can always consult with OIS advisors regarding their decision to travel internationally during the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic. On Monday, March 9 OIS shared a message with the UIC international community in which we strongly discouraged all international students, scholars and employees from traveling outside the U.S. in the near future and that it is not possible to guarantee that individuals will be able to return to the U.S. according to their plans. Our guidance remains the same although we understand that the decision to travel at this point is extremely personal. Those considering international travel with the intention of returning to the U.S. should check their documents before departure and plan for any necessary updates. Visa services at U.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad have been significantly impacted and in many cases suspended due to coronavirus/COVID-19. The U.S. Department of State has a list COVID-19 specific country information. Travel restrictions continue to be announced limiting entry to countries across the globe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains a list of current restrictions on travel to the U.S. Those who are successful in returning to the U.S. may be subject to self-isolation/quarantine before returning to campus. Please follow campus guidance as posted on today.uic.edu/coronavirus.",
        "Has USCIS announced any suspensions to their processing services related to employment petitions?",
        "Yes, on March 20 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced the immediate and temporary suspension of Premium Processing service of all Form I-129 petitions due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including cap-exempt petitioners such as UIC. Specifically, effective immediately, USCIS will not accept any new requests for Premium Processing of I-129 nonimmigrant petitions, which includes but is not limited to the H-1B and O-1 categories. It is expected that any Premium Processing requests received and accepted prior to March 20, 2020 will continue to be processed. If you have case-specific questions regarding how this may impact a matter currently being processed with our office, please contact an OIS advisor. As always, we will immediately notify our colleagues in human resources roles once USCIS has provided any update regarding Premium Processing.",
