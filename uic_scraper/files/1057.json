        "Waivers/Assistantships/Fellowships",
        "Waivers, assistantships, and fellowships are gift assistance that in most cases are awarded based on a student's field of study and/or employment status. Click on the appropriate link on the left for general information about waivers, assistantships and fellowships available to UIC students.",
        "Board of Trustees (BOT) Waivers are awarded by the Graduate College and individual graduate programs. The SFAS disburses the waivers but does not determine recipients. A student must be enrolled in a degree-seeking program at least 12 or more hours during the fall and spring semesters (6 or more during summer) at the end of the add/drop period for the waiver to pay. BOT waiver recipients must NOT have eligibility for a waiver from any other source (for example, an assistantship waiver) in order to remain eligible. If a student receives a waiver, his/her loan eligibility may be affected. For more information about Board of Trustees or Graduate College waivers, please see the Graduate College website.",
        "Students must report wavers to the SFAS upon receiving their electronic financial aid notification.",
        "The Child of Employee 50% Tuition Waiver (CETW) is available for undergraduate children of Illinois senior public university employees at participant schools. Fees and charges other than tuition are not included in this waiver. For detailed information about the policy, eligibility and application for the CETW waiver, please visit the Human Resource website.",
        "The Children of Veterans Tuition Waiver is awarded for four consecutive years at the University of Illinois to natural or legally adopted children of service members who are veterans of World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam Conflict, the Southwest Asia Conflict, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
        "The following are limitations to the Children of Veterans Tuition Waiver:",
        "Applications are available each December 1st and notifications are released by April 1st. All applications for the three University of Illinois campuses are reviewed in Urbana-Champaign and must be submitted accordingly.",
        "The Senior Citizen Tuition Waiver is available for undergraduate and graduate students who are 65 or over, Illinois residents, live in a low-income household (see application for details), are admitted to UIC and have completed the waiver application. The waiver covers tuition only. The application can be found here.",
        "UIC John Marshall Law School is a self-supporting college that does not receive any direct state appropriations. Accordingly, students who are also employees of the University of Illinois system are not eligible to receive tuition and fee waivers from UIC John Marshall based on their employment status.   University of Illinois employees may be eligible to be considered for merit-based scholarships awarded by the Law School under the same eligibility requirements as other law school students.",
        "Students with assistantship appointments may qualify to have tuition and some fees waived. To be eligible, the assistantship must be between 25%-67% and cover at least 91 continuous days of the fall or spring semesters (41 days for summer appointments). Visit the Human Resources website for more information. Students receive a monthly stipend from their hiring department that varies according to hours worked. Students must maintain enrollment in at least 8 credit hours for fall and spring and 3 hours for summer. For more information, see the Graduate College website.",
