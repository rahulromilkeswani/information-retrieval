        "Prior study: Successful applicants to the graduate programs in civil and materials engineering should have completed prior study at an accredited college or university in engineering or a related field.",
        "MS programs: Applicants to the MS programs should have earned a GPA of at least 2.75 on a scale of 4.0 based on the last 60 semester hours (or 90 quarter hours) of undergraduate study. Admission preference is given to students with stronger academic records. Interested in master’s-level study in our department? Download our MS programs booklet here.",
        "PhD programs: Doctoral program applicants should have earned a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a scale of 4.0, based on the last 60 semester hours (or 90 quarter hours) of undergraduate coursework completed. PhD applicants may apply after having completed (or with the expectation of soon completing) a master’s degree in engineering or a related field, or, via a program called “direct admission,” they may apply having only earned a bachelor’s degree. Please see the direct admission section below for more information.",
        "There are two phases to the admissions process for graduate study in civil and materials engineering.",
        "Step 1: Graduate College review. Prospective graduate students must apply for admission through the UIC Graduate College. Within two to three days of completing your online Graduate College application, you will receive an email acknowledging receipt and indicating that you can log back into the system to begin uploading supplementary application materials (see Step 2 below).",
        "Step 2: Departmental review. The department is very interested in reviewing the additional documents you will upload as part of the application process. These include your statement of purpose, résumé, GRE general test scores, specialization form (for PhD applicants only), and other documents you might want to submit for consideration. These documents will help to distinguish you from other applicants. The next section explains them in detail.",
        "Applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate College and the requirements of the civil and materials engineering department. In general, applicants should be prepared with the following:",
        "Most PhD applicants already have earned (or are about to complete) a master of science degree in engineering or a related field. However, exceptional applicants who seek to start the PhD with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.” Students who are admitted to the PhD program with only a bachelor’s degree in engineering or a related field must complete all 108 credit hours toward the PhD degree (compared with students entering with an MS degree, who can transfer in 32 earned credits from their master’s program).",
        "Current deadlines can be found on the Graduate College’s admissions deadlines page.",
        "Special note: To give prospective students additional time to prepare their applications, applications from U.S. students will be accepted until June 15, 2020, for the MS programs in civil engineering, materials engineering, and construction engineering and management."
