        "Introduction",
        "The UIC School of Public Health is dedicated to excellence in protecting and improving the health and well-being of the people of the Metropolitan Chicago area, the State of Illinois and the nation, and others throughout the world. We achieve this mission by: educating scientists, professionals, and the public; conducting research to develop solutions to public health problems; providing public health service; and formulating public health policy. Ours is a community of scholars, students, and staff dedicated to creating a healthy society. Along with academic excellence, the UIC School of Public Health fosters cutting-edge research and engaged community-based practice that focuses on eliminating health disparities and bringing public health solutions to communities in need.",
        "Whether a student is a freshman at UIC, a baccalaureate degree holder looking for graduate education in public health, a seasoned professional seeking specialized public health training, or simply wants to sample the field—the School of Public Health has something to offer. The UIC School of Public Health offers applicants a choice of degrees to pursue including the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health (BA), Bachelor of Science in Public Health (BS), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA), Master of Science (MS), Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Science (MSCTS), Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), and Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health (PhD). Our faculty and alumni continue to make solid contributions in Chicago and across the globe. Their vision, resolve, and ingenuity have built the foundation for a rich UIC public health legacy. Our students learn, innovate, practice, research, and challenge public health concepts in Chicago and in communities around the world.",
        "The mission of the baccalaureate program in public health is to engage and enlighten students about matters related to the health of societies locally, nationally, and globally. By systematically examining biological, environmental, cultural, behavioral, historical, economic, and political factors that mitigate health, students in the program will become informed citizens who can consider the public’s health in whatever life roles they assume. For those who go on to careers in medicine, nursing, dentistry, and other health-related professions, the baccalaureate program in public health builds upon a broad foundation in the biological and behavioral sciences imbued with social ecology and population–based perspectives. Graduates of the program acquire an array of skills that can be applied to many forms of inquiry, analysis, scientific and moral reasoning, and practice. At the baccalaureate level, graduates may seek employment in public health as communicable disease investigators, public health educators, program coordinators, environmental specialists, information specialists, and other roles commensurate with their skills. Those wishing to pursue professional careers in the public health arena will be well positioned to continue their studies through matriculation into master’s degree programs in public health. Emerging from the program with an informed understanding of public health, graduates embrace the vision of health equity and social justice.",

A program of 19 semester hours or more must be approved by the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Public Health.
