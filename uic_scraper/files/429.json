        "My research spans different aspects of data science, including machine learning, causal inference, graph mining, network science, and privacy. My research goal is to unify these aspects in a single framework that allows us to reason better with data and solve important societal problems. I am especially interested in algorithms for heterogeneous graphs and networks, with focus on the following goals:",

        "I am an assistant professor in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Prior to joining UIC, I spent a few years in industry as a data scientist, working on large-scale recommender systems, personalization, incentivized sharing, and data science tools for journalists. I built and led the data science team at LivingSocial, and later was a principal data scientist at Vox Media. I also spent a year in government as an AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow at the National Science Foundation, contributing to national initiatives at the intersection of data science and public policy. Many of the research problems I am interested to solve are informed by my industry and public policy experience. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2011 from the University of Maryland, College Park where my advisor was Lise Getoor."
