    "text": [
        "It’s never too early to start planning.",
        "Early preparation is the key to a smooth (and successful!) application and admission process. In the last few years, the number of applicants to our program has grown dramatically. We’re limited by space and resources.",
        "Give yourself the best chance of joining us by doing your research and putting your best application forward.",
        "On campus",
        "Applications are due March 31. We admit only for the fall term. The admissions process doesn’t actually begin until spring, but applications are accepted from August 1 to May 1.",
        "Online",
        "Online program applications are accepted on a rolling admission schedule. Applications are due July 1 for Fall and November 1 for Spring term.",
        "Don’t wait until the last minute to apply! We encourage you to apply early in the fall of the year before you complete your prerequisites. Start early and give yourself plenty of time to collect all your materials.",
        "The general education requirements may be completed online at UIC through Online Pathways. See which subject areas we recommend to fulfill our general education requirements.",
        "International Students: If English isn’t your native language, you might need to take an English proficiency test. Check out the International Requirements to see if this applies to you.",
        "When you apply, you’ll need to submit your transcripts, resume, three letters of recommendation and a course outline form. If you’re a UIC intercollege transfer, you’ll also need to complete a college and employment history form. Get started on those now! Refer to the Applying page for all the specifics.",
        "The application process is paperless. Please don’t mail any materials or credentials to the University unless told to do so. Documents that you will upload must be in PDF format, no larger than 5 MB in size. “Portfolio” PDFs and secured PDFs which require a password are not compatible with our system.",
        "International Students: You might have a few extra things you need to provide. Read through the International Requirements page to make sure you have everything ready.",
        "Student financial aid can come from various sources. Some scholarships evaluate financial need, so be sure complete the Free Application for Federal Student Financial Aid (FAFSA) to determine what aid you may be eligible to receive.",
        "You can also look for external scholaships and awards from AHIMA and HIMSS."
