This is an opportunity for you to let your voice be heard as you vote for the candidate(s) that best represent you. In November 2018, Chicago had its highest voter turnout for a midterm election in 32 years, with over one-quarter of all ballots being cast by voters ages 18 to 34. As Chicago’s public research university, it is our responsibility to keep the momentum going.",
