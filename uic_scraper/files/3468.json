        "The main interest is in dusty plasma with particular application to nanoparticle coating. Various methods are used, including Particle-in-Cell (PIC) and fluid model, for simulation of charging, levitation and coating.",
        "The mechanism of liquid atomization is significantly enhanced by injecting electric charge. Both experiments and simulations are used to develop a better understanding of the charging process and to apply this atomization method in practice.",
        "In our work we investigate chemistry, electro-chemistry and mechanics (elasto-plastic deformation) of secondary (rechargeable) batteries, together with the next-generation low temperature electrochemical energy conversion technologies.",
