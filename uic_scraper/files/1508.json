    "title": "Academic Hiring Guidelines for the University Search Process | Office for Access and Equity | University of Illinois at Chicago",
    "text": [
        "Policy Guidelines",
        "In accordance with UIC's equal opportunity and affirmative action obligations, all salaried Academic Professional and Faculty positions which are 50% time or greater, including Visiting Academic Professional Appointments must be filled via an open and competitive search process. This included public posting of the search for a minimum of two weeks. Postings can be online or print.",
        "Limited searches for some administrative and faculty positions may be restricted to the University campus or even to the unit in which the position resides. These exceptional searches might be justified by the qualifications sought, e.g., direct experience with the University of Illinois system or tenured faculty at the UIC campus.",
        "Reminder: Individuals appointed to positions without a search being conducted must be informed that subsequent offers of employment will not be made unless they are selected as the result of an approved search.",
        "Each year a few appointments are made and some promotions are granted without going through the standard search procedures. These positions are eligible for search waiver requests due to (a) the existence of statutory or other policy guidelines governing the appointment or search process; (b) the unique talents and skills required for the position; or (c) urgent departmental/unit teaching needs that cannot be addressed through the normal search process (i.e., increased class enrollment at the beginning of a semester requiring an immediate teaching appointment).  Search waivers should be used for appointing individuals to positions within jobs groups in the academic Affirmative Action Plan. Individuals may be external to the University or may be employed in an exempt position. A request for a search waiver must include a justification detailing evidence for why a search cannot be conducted, efforts made to seek underrepresented candidates, how the individual for whom the waiver is sought was identified, and confirmation of no others at the university with similar duties or titles eligible to compete for the position.",
        "Note: The eligibility of a position for a search waiver does not exempt a position from affirmative action requirements and equal employment opportunity regulations, including documenting good faith efforts to achieve diversity and ensuring non-discrimination.",
        "A. Appointments eligible for Search Waivers based on statutory and campus policy objectives",
        "B. Appointments Eligible for a Search Waiver based on urgent departmental/unit needs that cannot be addressed through the normal search process (i.e., increased class enrollment at the beginning of a semester requiring an immediate teaching appointment).",
        "Note: These positions should generally be filled through an open and competitive process. When, however, urgent and unforeseen circumstances arise requiring the immediate filling of a vacancy to further the campus’ mission and objectives, a waiver may be requested. The waiver should generally be for a limited time (i.e., one semester) to address the immediate need.",
        "",
        "C. Appointments Eligible for a Search Waiver based on the unique talents, skills, and experience required for the position",
        "To obtain a waiver, a Request for Waiver of Search Process form must be submitted to OAE along with supporting documentation:",
        "OAE will review waivers on a case-by case basis and will consider several factors (as appropriate) in our review:",
        "a) Whether an internal search within the unit may be appropriate to allow other potentially interested and qualified individuals to apply, particularly if there are other employees within the department/unit with similar titles, qualifications, and/or job titles",
        "b) Whether the proposed change is consistent with the principles of affirmative action, equal employment opportunity, and diversity",
        "c) Whether there is an Affirmative Action goal for the position’s job group; whether the unit has undertaken a comprehensive review of their current employment workforce to ensure fairness and equity in promotion opportunities, particularly with respect to traditionally underrepresented groups",
        "d) Whether the change will create the opportunity for a vacancy to be filled through a competitive search",
        "Note: Requests for appointment changes and search waivers must be accompanied by appropriate justification and documentation. The requests must include the resume/vita of the individual; a discussion of the individual’s qualifications for the position; and an explanation of the justification for not conducting an open and competitive process. The request should indicate how the individual was identified and should indicate efforts undertaken to identify underrepresented individuals, particularly if the position is part of the campus’ affirmative action plan. If the request is based upon reorganization or promotion, the existing organizational chart and proposed organizational chart should be submitted. Neither an informal verbal offer nor a formal written offer can be extended until the search waiver is approved by OAE."
