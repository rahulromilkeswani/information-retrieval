        "Walter and I need help getting the new ACM site current before Fall semester.  Here's what we need from SIG leaders, ACM officers, and other contributors:",
        "Please post thoughts & questions as comments to this post.  I don't mind editing pages for people as long as I have the updated info.",
        "",
        "I think all of the SIGs are experiencing erratic schedules and low participation rates at the moment, although I can only officially comment on SIGBUILD.",
        "SIGBUILD is not actively meeting at present due to a variety of factors.  If anyone is interested in meeting, please email me ahead of time and we will plan to work on some project stuff (Thursdays are still good for me).",
        "Otherwise, we will be ramping it back up in Fall.",
        "I was just testing to see if it wouldn't break, but a notice to all users: making a \"Story\" will show up on the main page.  I don't know if it's a new feature, but I will abuse it heavily for the next minute, by which I'm sure to get bored.",
        "Anyway, to be constructive, everybody remember that despite the summer season, most of the SIG's are still going strong.  SIG Web still meets every week (I believe SIG Web is contributing to the changes made to the site), and I have no reason to believe that SIG Game is not meeting weekly either.  SIG Build is a different story, but Robert will tell you about that in the next \"Story\" (yes, I know the future).",
        "P.S. Where do my pages go?!",
        "Welcome to the new ACM website! Certain parts of the website are still under construction, so don't be alarmed if some things are not working correctly or are currently missing. The new website utilizes an LDAP back-end, so logging in should be done with one's ACM account credentials. Full functionality, as well as all the old website posts, should be done before the start of the fall semester.",
