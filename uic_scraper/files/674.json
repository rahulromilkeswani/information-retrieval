        "Officials at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Illinois System and public health officials locally and nationally, are closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus, named COVID-19.",
        "UIC has created a central webpage to bring the latest news and information about COVID-19 to the campus community. Use the link below to stay informed.",
        "“The UIC RN to BSN program really opens your eyes to looking at nursing differently, not just the skills that you do and checking them off of the list but looking at a broader understanding of nursing.”",
        "“I’ve advanced my career, helped my company, and positioned myself for even greater future success. I highly recommend the UIC online quantitative research program for anyone interested in leading the charge in evidence-based decision making.”",
        "The University of Illinois at Chicago is a member of the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements. Learn about The University of Illinois System SARA compliance, including licensing and complaint information."
