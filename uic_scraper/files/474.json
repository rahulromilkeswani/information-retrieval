        "To view your outstanding charges, log into your UIC Library Account and select Fines from the right-hand menu. For Questions or assistance, you can submit a ticket to Ask a Librarian or call the Daley Circulation unit at (312) 996-2724.",
        "Borrowers are responsible for library materials until they are checked in at an appropriate location.",
        "The library is not responsible for notifying borrowers that materials are overdue. Reminders and overdue notices are mailed as a courtesy. Failure to receive reminders or overdue notices does not excuse borrowers from the responsibility of returning or renewing items on time to avoid penalties.",
        "Users are responsible for paying all outstanding fines and other fees. Faculty and staff are not assessed fines, but will be billed for damaged or lost items.",
        "The UIC Daley Library does not charge overdue fines for most circulating items. There are exceptions:",
        "Overdue fines apply at all times, including holidays, vacations and intersession. All overdue items that exceed their fine limit or have not been returned after 39 days are billed to the user account as “Lost”.",
        "UIC materials that are not returned or renewed within 39 days after their due date are automatically marked with a “Lost” status and billed to the user. The following fees are charged for each item that is “Lost”:",
        "For items returned within 1 year after being marked “Lost”, the replacement fee will be waived, but any overdue fines or processing fees incurred will remain. After 1 year, users must discuss their balance with Library.",
        "The charge for damaged items will be determined by the Library depending on an assessment of the severity of the damage, up to the full replacement fee of $125.",
        "Damaged items may be replaced by borrowers in lieu of paying the replacement costs.",
        "Charges for damaged Interlibrary Loan or I-Share items from other institutions are determined by the lending library.",
        "The Daley Library will accept a replacement copy of a lost or damaged UIC item in lieu of the lost item replacement fee",
        "Replacement copies must match the lost item based on title, edition, and ISBN or ISSN number, and must be new or used in very good or better condition (clean, unmarked, untorn, with an intact spine and binding).",
        "Former library copies cannot be accepted.",
        "Interlibrary Loan or I-Share items may be eligible for replacement. Contact the lending library for details.",
        "All replacement copies should be brought to a Daley Library Circulation supervisor in-person. If an item must be mailed, it must include your name and contact information, as well as a note that identifies the item as a replacement, so we can process the book correctly and credit your account.",
        "The Library reserves the right to determine whether a replacement copy is acceptable.",
        "Payments are not accepted at the Library. Charges can be paid through the Office of Business and Financial Services.",
        "Refunds are given for paid replacement charges only for UIC library materials returned in good condition within 1 year from the original due date.",
        "If you find and return an item within 1 year of paying for its replacement, contact Circulation to request a refund of the lost item replacement fee.",
        "An outstanding balance will result in the temporary suspension of borrowing and renewing privileges and an academic block at the University Registrar. Outstanding overdue materials borrowed through ILL and I-Share can also result in an academic block.",
        "This block will prevent future enrollment/registration and access to other University services (including transcript requests and the receipt of graduation diplomas) until charges are resolved.",
        "Academic blocks are removed within 5 to 10 business days after library charges are resolved.",
        "Please submit a ticket to UIC Ask a Librarian to appeal any fines you feel were assessed in error, to claim that you’ve already returned or never borrowed an item checked out to your account, or to report a lost or damaged item.  You can also call the Circulation unit at (312) 996-2724.",
        "Library staff will review your appeal or claim and grant or deny it based on the circumstances, including your overall library record. Items claimed returned will be searched for by library staff twice over a 3-week period; if not found, library staff will declare the item “Lost” and the item will be billed.",
