        "As a computer science student, you represent the department as you interact with the UIC community. We expect all of our students to conduct themselves in a courteous, respectful, and professional manner. If you have a grievance related to a particular course, please discuss it with the instructor first and see if the issue can be resolved. If you are not satisfied with the response from the instructor, stop by the CS Student Affairs office or make an appointment to speak with the director of graduate studies (dgs@cs.uic.edu).",
        "All requests for letters should be submitted via email to grad@cs.uic.edu including your name, UIN, degree, and details about the information needed in the letter. Letters are usually processed and ready for pickup in one to two business days. An email will be sent when the letter is ready. Walk-in requests are not accommodated. These are the most common letters requested:",
        "Curricular Practical Training is permission for international students to work off-campus at an internship while they are enrolled at UIC. CPT is handled through the College of Engineering’s Engineering Career Center. CS does not allow any students who are not in good standing (those who have a GPA below 3.0) to participate in CPT.",
        "Optional Practical Training is another program through which international students can gain work experience in the United States. CS issues approvals for OPT at the conclusion of the degree program. Candidates for OPT must be in good and full standing. Students on limited standing, students who have not satisfied the degree requirements, and students whose GPA is less than 3.0 will not receive approval for OPT until these issues are resolved. The OPT process must be started early; contact the Office of International Services for information. Please note that the OPT authorization/approval required by OIS can be provided only by the staff in the CS Student Affairs office. Approval from CS faculty advisors is not acceptable.",
        "Graduate program requirements manuals from past years:",
        "UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. Students who face or anticipate disability-related barriers while at UIC should connect with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) on the web at drc.uic.edu, by email at drc@uic.edu, or by phone at (312) 413-2183 to create a plan for reasonable accommodations.",
        "In order to receive accommodations, students must disclose disability to the DRC, complete an interactive registration process with the DRC, and provide their course instructor with a Letter of Accommodation. Course instructors in receipt of a Letter of Accommodation will work with the student and the DRC to implement approved accommodations."
