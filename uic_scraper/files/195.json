        "The Counseling Center provides diverse services to help students deal with stress, handle a crisis or trauma, cope with the transition to college, gain strength from gender and cultural identity, or manage serious mental illness and many other issues. Our counselors can help students increase resilience and positive well-being by developing effective coping and problem-solving skills.",
        "Due to utmost concerns for health and safety during this time of COVID-19, the Counseling Center is no longer open for face-to-face appointments and is now functioning entirely remotely. You may still call the Counseling Center phone number at 312-996-3490 during current business hours (9am-5pm) to schedule an appointment or to contact a counselor. If calling after hours, press 2 to be connected to a crisis counselor.",

        "-Counselors are providing individual therapy services by video (using Webex) and phone, with video being preferred.",

        "-If you are currently receiving psychiatric services at the Counseling Center, please email your psychiatrist to arrange for a time to speak with her about plans for your continued treatment during this time.",
        "-If you suspect you have come into contact with someone with the coronavirus, or are having symptoms of fever, cough or difficulty breathing, we ask that you seek medical evaluation.  If you need to speak with a counselor urgently or need other resources, let us know during your call.",
        "For faculty and staff:",
