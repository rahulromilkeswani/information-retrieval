Peer mentoring, tutoring and specialized workshops make your academic experience better.",
        "All students are encouraged to take advantage of these resources and academic guidance.",
        "Most students need help paying for college. UIC’s Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships can advise you on the paperwork required and deadlines that must be met to apply for loans and grants. They can also tell you about public and private scholarships.",
        "The Office of External Fellowships provides extensive advisement and assistance to current undergraduate and professional school students, and to recent alumni, in finding and applying for nationally- and internationally-competitive fellowships, scholarships, and grants. Graduate students can find similar help directly from the Graduate College.",
        "The Student Employment Office can help you find a part-time job, either working for UIC on campus or for an off-campus employer.",
        "",
        "College is more than academics. The opportunity to grow socially and culturally is just as important. UIC offers resources dedicated to student involvement, support, networking and social interaction.",
        "The Center for Student Involvement is your source for live events, cultural programs, diverse student organizations and student-produced entertainment.",
        "The Office of Diversity oversees seven Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change that provide support to specific populations on campus and opportunities for intercultural engagement among students, faculty, staff and Chicago communities.",
        "At UIC, our students’ health and well-being are just as important as their classroom success.  That’s why all students are automatically enrolled in the convenient CampusCare health insurance program. CampusCare provides students with basic health services on campus. The Family Medicine Center also offers care to students and provides referrals to specialty services.",
        "Students can work out, take a class, train with an instructor or get a massage at UIC’s state-of-the-art fitness centers. The Wellness Center promotes healthy attitudes and behaviors through information, educational programs and skill-building activities. UIC’s Counseling Center helps students deal with stress, cope with the transition to college, gain strength from gender and cultural identity, and manage mental illness.",
        "An exciting future lies beyond the walls of UIC, and we want to assist you in your transition from student to professional.",
        "The Office of Career Services provides educational workshops to help you write résumés and cover letters, search for jobs, learn interview and networking tips, use social media in your job search and many more topics. The office also provides guidance if you are undecided in your major or are considering graduate school.",
        "We can also help you navigate job sites on the Internet, find career fairs and secure an internship.",
        "Your new career awaits. We can help make it happen."
