        "An I-94 is an arrival and departure record that you receive at  the Port  of Entry (such as the airport) when entering the U.S. For individuals  arriving after 04/26/2013, the I-94 is accessible online.  Prior to 04/26/2013 the I-94 was a paper form filled out at the Port of  Entry or on the airplane. Your I-94 must remain valid at  all times. When departing the U.S., you will turn in your I-94 paper card (if  applicable),  unless you are taking advantage of AVR.* If you forget to  return your  I-94 when exiting the U.S. permanently, you should follow instructions to make an effort to send it back to Department of Homeland Security (DHS/immigration).",
