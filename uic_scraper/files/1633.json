        "At UIC, graduate students in electrical and computer engineering have access to the world-class faculty expertise, personalized one-on-one mentoring, and computing facilities needed to define their career path in academia or industry.",
        "Advanced study in ECE at UIC is offered at the master's and doctoral levels. Students here benefit from distinct advantages that set the stage for their future success:",
        "UIC is Chicago’s public research university. This is a place where sharp, analytical researchers unearth the causes of problems and develop innovative solutions. UIC ECE scholars are conducting investigations on the leading edge of nanoscale devices and systems, signal and image processing, communication theory and systems, robotics and control, electronic circuits and systems, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and many other topics. Our public research mission drives us to produce findings that lead to improvements in quality of life: in Chicago and around the world.",
        "Mentoring is key. Graduate students in ECE benefit from the time and expertise of faculty who also are full members in the UIC Graduate College. PhD and master’s students collaborate with top-tier faculty mentors and with one another, producing projects that are interdisciplinary, groundbreaking, and relevant to the world. All UIC students receive one-on-one attention that helps them to achieve their goals, whether their interests are theoretical or practical, and whether their future lies in industry, academia, or government.",
        "Enjoy the major advantages of a major metropolitan area. Chicago is an extraordinary commercial and cultural center. UIC students have the opportunity to conduct research and practical projects for Chicago-based firms. They commonly hold internships at corporations and government agencies throughout the region. They also have direct access to a large urban population whose needs can inform and inspire engineering research. If the goal of engineering is to develop creative, innovative applied solutions to improve the way we live, learning in a city like Chicago can help you take your thinking and planning to the next level.",
        "Focus on your interest—in the program that works for you. UIC ECE offers master’s degrees and doctoral degrees in electrical and computer engineering. In addition, close ties between ECE and the College of Engineering’s other five departments—computer science, bioengineering, civil and materials engineering, chemical engineering, and mechanical and industrial engineering—ensure that no matter what projects you want to pursue, we have the resources and the collaborators you will need to make it happen."
