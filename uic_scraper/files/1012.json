        "Since there is no class held on MLK Day, we characterize it as “a day on, not a day off.\" Efforts are made to collaborate with other Chicago events and community areas.",
        "2020 Impact:",
        "On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2020, the UIC community came together to volunteer at 13 different projects across 8 different service sites, such as at the Stone Temple Baptist Church (where MLK spoke during the civil rights movement), Girls in the Game, and Hope House. There were a total of 173 participants that gave 572 hours! Great job, Flames!",
        "In the Past:",
        "January 2019 - Approximately 171 students, faculty, staff, and friends of UIC served at 9 sites across Chicago. Participants gave nearly 700 hours of service to organizations that resulted in an economic impact of over $18,000.",
