        "To cope with the loss of his father at age 6 and contend",
        "with the danger of a civil war, he remained strong in mind and spirit with the",
        "help of his mother and brother.",
        "In 2015, he was well-served by his confident determination upon immigrating to the U.S., where he had to quickly adjust to a new culture, become fluent in English and begin his senior year at Wheeling High School.",
        "Educational goals and opportunities",
        "to improve the quality of life for himself and others have been consistent",
        "motivating forces for Barmada from Syria to UIC, where he has been an Honors",

        "for the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarship for graduate studies at the",
        "University of Cambridge.",
        "Barmada earned the honor through a highly competitive",
        "selection process, which emphasizes outstanding academic achievement and social",
        "leadership. The newly elected international cohort joins more than two dozen",
        "scholars from the U.S., who were announced in February, to complete the Gates",

        "social and clinical challenges facing the use of omics-based personalized",
        "medicine across everyday clinics,” he said. “Professionally, I intend to pursue",
        "an MD/Ph.D. advancing biochemical and computational technologies to address",
        "currently incurable diseases and contributing to the crafting of a new era of",
        "health care without disparities.”",
        "Barmada, who is minoring in mathematics, is part of the",
        "President’s Award Program STEM Initiative at UIC, which is a selective peer and",

        "Since his first year at UIC, he has conducted research on",
        "diabetic eye disease in the laboratory of Scott Shippy, UIC associate professor",
        "of chemistry and bioengineering, while also volunteering at an ophthalmology",
        "clinic that serves patients of the same life-changing, blindness-causing",
        "disease conditions.",
        "“Through these experiences, I found an articulation of my",
        "interests in patient-driven research that considers both the biochemical and",
        "socioeconomic lenses,” he said.",
        "Shippy considers Barmada “nothing short of remarkable” and,",
        "as an example, noted his key role in the lab’s project to collect tears from",
        "mice to look for markers of disease that resulted in two first-author",
        "publications from the young researcher.",
        "“He has grown tremendously from those first days learning",
        "the basic lab techniques to the present day with a research-oriented opinion",
        "article under review in an ophthalmology journal,” Shippy said. “With his",
        "intellect and astounding work ethic, I predict he will have a large impact on",
        "the future of health care as a scientist-physician.”",
        "The Gates Cambridge Scholarship is the latest honor for",

        "precious lessons that schools cannot teach,” said Barmada in a 2019 interview",
        "with UIC Today. “What keeps me motivated in my research is that although I do",
        "not know if there is a cure for every disease, I know we simply must work hard",
