        "Chicago Signature Honors Programming is a great way for UIC Honors students to experience amazing cultural and educational opportunities outside of class at no cost! Pioneered by Dr. Ekaterina Pirozhenko, it is currently run by Honors College’s Program Coordinator & Assistant to the Dean, Tyler Nielsen.",
        "This extracurricular initiative engages students with the cultural and intellectual diversity that only Chicago can provide. The program engages students intellectually, culturally, and artistically, while also providing students with mentoring outside the traditional classroom and office setting.  In the past, students have enjoyed performances at the Lyric Opera, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Steppenwolf, the Goethe Institute, Prop Theatre, the Athenaeum Theatre, the Mercury Theatre, UIC Theatre, the Hellenic Museum, the National Museum of Mexican Art, Christkindlmarket, Chinatown, and Little Village, and often are able to speak with players, directors and artists — all at no cost to the students.",
        "In response to public health concerns surrounding COVID-19, all upcoming CSHP events have been suspended in the best interest of students, fellow patrons, and the artistic community. We hope you will join us again another term!",
        "Attendance to Chicago Signature Honors Programming events is open to all students currently enrolled in the Honors College at the University of Illinois-Chicago.  Each event listing has an RSVP link. By RSVP’ing, you are committing to going to the event sponsored through Honors College. Upon registration you will receive a confirmation from the system letting you know that you have either A) registered successfully or B) have been placed on a waitlist as the event has already reached capacity. Those who registered successfully will receive an email at least 48 hours prior to the outing with critical information regarding directions, guidelines and information on how to obtain your ticket.",
        "As college funds are allocated for and spent on this educational program based on RSVP counts, it is your responsibility to show up to the event that you signed up for. If you are unable to attend an event after registering, please get in touch with the administrators who run the program as soon as possible (via cshp@uic.edu, no later than 8am the day of the event) so that your ticket may be given to the next person on the wait-list. Students who fail to attend an event for which they have RSVP’d without timely communication to the program administrators of said non-attendance, will require the student to reimburse the Honors College for the cost of their ticket, as a ticket was been wasted that could have instead been used to sponsor another student’s experience.",
        "All questions and concerns should be directed to cshp@uic.edu"
