        "Location: ACM Office" maybe you didn't know where to start or who to talk to? Well SIG-Android is here with me, Lukasz Stempniewicz, who will be introducing people to programming with android! We will start from the very beginning and move on from there. This is my first time doing this so I'm not sure exactly how fast everyone will catch onto things, maybe everyone who comes has already programmed android and just wants to explore new features of the newest firmware? Who knows? If the group wants to go in a different direction later on and learn something else we can do that, or we may have a competition of some sort. I have planned the first 7 meetups already.",
