        "Welcome to the UIC Counseling Center",
        "Questions, choices, concerns and changes are all part of what students experience during college. Many times you can work through them on your own or with the help of friends, family, or a partner. Sometimes, the issues can feel too private, overwhelming or complicated to share with someone you know or you may have become isolated from available support. Talking with a Counseling Center professional can provide the safe, supportive, confidential setting to explore your concerns towards improving your emotional, physical and academic functioning.",
        "Fortunately, the Counseling Center provides diverse services to help students deal with stress, handle a crisis or trauma, cope with the transition to college, gain strength from gender and cultural identity, or manage serious mental illness and many other issues. Our counselors can help students increase resilience and positive well-being by developing effective coping and problem-solving skills. The Counseling Center is supported by the Health Service Fee as assessed to all students enrolled at the university and therefore enrolled students are eligible for Counseling Center mental health services without additional cost.",
        "If you are a faculty, staff, parent, partner, or student who is concerned about a distressed student, the Counseling Center also provides consultation to assist in determining how you might best help."
