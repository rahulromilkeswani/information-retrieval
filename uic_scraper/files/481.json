        "Additional Learning, Teaching and Working Resources",
        "We encourage you to access our many collections and services online. The Library subscribes to tens of thousands of online resources that can be searched through our Library website at library.uic.edu. Hundreds of research guides provide information about specific disciplinary resources as well as about issues such as copyright, which may be on your mind as you move your courses online. In addition, many publishers and vendors are increasing access to their offerings during this crisis.",
        "Chat with a Librarian is available from Sun. to Thurs., 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.; Fri., 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; and Sat., 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. All other inquiries submitted through email will be answered within 24 hours. Library faculty are also available for virtual research consultations – fill out the form, and a librarian will send a link to WebEx for the appointment.",
        "Publishers have made selected electronic resources temporarily open access to aid online instruction and research during the COVID-19 emergency so that educators and researchers can use them easily as they adapt their courses online. The UIC University Library will continue to add new resources to this list as they become available. Please visit this page often for the latest updates.",

        "Articles and book chapters (PDFs) can still be requested via Interlibrary Loan, but service is limited by closures at other libraries. Books and other physical material are not available by I-Share or Interlibrary Loan until further notice.",
        "Do not worry about being charged; the Library has shut down overdue and lost notices during this time.  Materials that become overdue or begin to incur fees after March 14, 2020 will be granted amnesty until further notice. Please renew your books at My Accounts if you are able.",
        "Once normal operations resume and it is safe to do so, please return the materials to the Library and ask for return receipts.",
        "No new print materials are being ordered currently. Because of a systems migration unrelated to COVID-19, all faculty requests for e-books or streaming media are due by April 15. Requests received after that date will be processed in July (crisis conditions permitting).",
        "The Library’s COVID-19 research guide contains a rich array of resources, primarily geared toward researchers.",
