        "Always Active",
        "At UIC, there’s a lot to learn",
        "University of Illinois at Chicago features 16 academic colleges, 86 bachelor’s, 111 master’s and 66 doctoral degree programs. That means plenty of opportunities to explore your interests.",
        "At UIC, you’ll learn from award-winning professors: American Association for the Advancement of Science fellows, Fulbright scholars and National Science Foundation Career Award winners.",
        "With nearly 2,821 faculty members and a low 1-to-19 faculty-student ratio, UIC undergraduates have exceptional access to the scientists, artists, writers, clinicians, educators and innovators whose work shapes our world.",
        "UIC courses in the arts and humanities help students develop critical-thinking skills and a comprehensive world view.",
        "The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts is a diverse community of artists, architects, designers and performers. Humanities studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences —  including the School of Literatures, Cultural Studies and Linguistics — reflect the global identities of UIC and Chicago.",
        "The UIC Innovation Center is a place for collaboration, education and incubation that brings together industry, educators and students to find solutions to real-world problems. Students in the MAD Lab (Medical Accelerator for Devices) created a diagnostic tool for women’s health exams.",
        "Whether you want to view the world through an electron microscope or the perspective of an entire culture, UIC offers a broad range of programs in the basic and social sciences. UIC researchers study important issues like energy production and conservation, the survival of wildlife in the city, the cultures of lost Amazonian civilizations and the behaviors that surround binge-drinking. Their work translates into classroom learning and student research opportunities.",
        "UIC produces leaders for the global economy of the future. The College of Business Administration reinforces the core disciplines — accounting, finance, information and decision sciences, marketing and management — with solid, real-world experience.",
        "For students whose career goals expand beyond one area of study, UIC offers joint degree options that combine business with medicine, public health, pharmacy, economics, nursing and management information systems.",
        "Today’s financial trading relies on high-speed software and instant access to real-time information from enormous volumes of data. In its market training lab, UIC’s International Center for Futures and Derivatives teaches students in an environment that simulates the trading room at a big investment firm.",
        "UIC is a place where ideas become reality. Researchers are designing more efficient batteries and more powerful computer chips, finding better ways to manage storm water surge and making microelectronics for space exploration. If you’re interested in computer science — gaming, manipulation of big data, computers that understand natural language or visualization, securing healthcare data, the intersection of art and science — you’ll find it at UIC.",
        "UIC’s health sciences colleges emphasize clinical skills, research and community focus. You can prepare for a wide range of health careers in one of the applied health sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health or social work. Ten pre-health programs in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences prepare students for future study in UIC health sciences programs and veterinary medicine.",
        "For students whose goals expand beyond one area of study, UIC offers joint degrees that combine health care studies with other disciplines. The Medical Scientist Training Program is an MD/Ph.D. program for physician-scientists. Bioengineering, a department in both the colleges of Medicine and Engineering, trains students for careers in the growing biomedical field.",
        "UIC has more than seven dedicated simulation centers that use specially trained actors, advanced and computerized manikins of all ages, and simulated environments to help students and health care professionals practice clinical skills, communication and decision-making skills, and get hands-on training in medical diagnosis, treatment and care. Together, these centers facilitate more than 50,000 hours of hands-on learning in the health sciences.",
        "UIC is the home to Chicago’s only public law school. Through its varied juris doctor and graduate degree programs, UIC John Marshall Law School provides an education that combines the understanding of both the theory and the practice of law. Students seeking degrees from the School have the option to study many substantive areas of the law – from tax law and estate planning to sustainability and international human rights – and benefit from its many educational centers and nine community-based, pro bono legal clinics.",
        "UIC offers more than 200 courses focused on issues of equality, fairness and inclusion. A minor in social justice in Gender and Women’s Studies explores ethical, social, historical and political questions facing Chicago and the world. Students and faculty are involved in social justice work, from public policy to arts projects, human rights to urban health disparities.",
        "",
        "The UIC Social Justice Initiative links scholars and activists in Chicago and beyond through programs related to social justice, democracy and human rights. The campus-wide project builds critical thinking and research skills that make students effective change agents and socially conscious professionals.",
        "UIC educates city planners and administrators to evaluate needs, find solutions — then make them happen.",
        "The College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs offers undergraduate and degrees, including Chicago’s only accredited graduate program in urban planning.  Eight research centers specialize in neighborhood development, economics, transportation, race and public policy, criminal justice and other issues.",
        "A gentrification index developed by UIC researchers measures neighborhood change in Chicago’s 77 community areas. It quantifies each area’s residents by ethnicity, age, education, income, occupation, home ownership and home values. Researchers found more neighborhoods declining than gentrifying, despite concerns that long-time residents are being priced out of some areas."
