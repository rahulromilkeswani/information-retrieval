        "What is the e-CHUG?",
        "The e-CHUG (electronic Check-Up to Go) is an interactive web survey that allows college and university students to enter information about their drinking patterns and receive feedback about their use of alcohol. The assessment takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete, is self-guided, and requires no face-to-face contact time with a counselor or administrator. This is not meant to be a formal self-assessment or diagnosis of whether or not you have a drinking problem. Instead this tool will increase your alcohol knowledge and your awareness about your own behaviors and the choices you make.",
        "What does it do?",
        "When you access the e-CHUG, you are prompted to enter information about yourself. In addition to demographic information, it will ask you to enter information about your drinking habits, family history, and to complete the World Health Organization's AUDIT.",
        "After all information has been entered, you submit the form. The information you entered is then validated and processed. The e-CHUG calculates a number of variables and compares your responses to national and local college norms. Then, your personalized feedback is displayed in an easy-to-read format.",
