        "In addition to the general rare book collection, the University Library acquires books from individual collectors. The books in these named collections and all other rare books can be found in the Library Catalog. These books cannot be checked out and must be read in Chicago in the Special Collections and University Archives reading rooms in Richard J. Daley Library or in Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago.",
        "The primary focus of the Rare Books Section at the Daley Library in Chicago is the political, social, architectural and literary history of Chicago. We also have collections that pertain to military history, American Indian culture and the Caribbean.",
        "At Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago, the strengths of the Rare Books Section are neurology, urology, dermatology, and the history of medicine. We also hold collections of early anatomies, herbals, pharmacopeias, and formularies.",
