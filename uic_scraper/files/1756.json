        "You can find an ongoing schedule of Honors College Events and Programs here.",
        "HCAB plans regular events and programs for Honors College students, typically hosted during their weekly extended hours in the Honors College. These events are opportunities for students to build community, engage in social and creative programming, connect with campus partners through workshops and information sessions, and use the Honors College space after regular business hours.",
        "HCAB is also responsible for planning the annual Honors College Ball. This is a formal event, hosted on campus, that allows students to dress up for a fun evening of music and dancing. The Ball is scheduled during the spring semester, usually occurring in March or early April. More information can be found for current students via the Honors College Announcements or on the HCAB Facebook page. The Honors College Ball is open to all UIC students.",
        "The Honors College organizes a luncheon for students and faculty each semester. Honors College students are encouraged to attend these functions to get acquainted with other students and faculty, especially their Honors College Fellows.",
        "The Honors College offers workshops throughout the academic year that allow students to connect with alumni in their professional fields, as well as learn about additional opportunities. Previous events include:",
        "This extracurricular initiative engages students with the cultural and intellectual diversity that only the Chicago urban environment can provide. The program engages students intellectually, culturally, and artistically, while also providing students with mentoring outside the traditional classroom and office setting.  In the past, students have enjoyed performances at the Lyric Opera, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Steppenwolf, the Goethe Institute, Prop Theatre, the Athenaeum Theatre, the Mercury Theatre, UIC Theatre, the Hellenic Museum, the National Museum of Mexican Art, Christkindlmarket, Chinatown, and Little Village, and often are able to speak with players, directors and artists — all at no cost to the students.",
        "Learn more about CSHP events as well as how to register here.",
        "Hosted by the Honors College Diversity Committee, the Coffee Hour Discussion Series takes place the last Wednesday of each month and aims to elevate student awareness with respect to critical issues related to diversity facing our own as well as neighboring communities. In addition, this series aims to better serve the diverse needs of our student body and to realize the benefits of a diverse learning environment for all. Light refreshments are served at each event and attendance is not limited to Honors College students; we accept students from all corners of campus.",
        "Be sure to check the Honors College Announcements for information about these events!",
        "The Honors College Convocation is a formal and personal way to acknowledge the success of graduating seniors. At the ceremony, students wear their commencement robes, and receive their gold stoles and a certificate of achievement. A leading scholar and an Honors College graduating senior are asked to speak. A reception for the students, their families, and Honors College staff and faculty follows. Find more information here."
