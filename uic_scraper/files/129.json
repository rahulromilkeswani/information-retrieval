        "A core part of UIC Engineering's mission is to increase the diversity of the engineering field. We pursue this goal in two ways: by recruiting students who reflect a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds and by providing programs that ensure the academic and professional success of students who choose UIC.",
        "At UIC, we take a broad view of diversity. Demographic diversity is important to us, and it is reflected among our student, faculty, and administrators. Going further, we also feel that diversity represents “the totality of the ways that people are similar and different,” to quote a university document that guides our thinking on the subject.",
        "This means we seek to develop a community that is inclusive by race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation and identity, disability, national origin and citizenship status, age, language, culture, religion, and economic status. These criteria hold special importance in cases when similarities and differences within them are used in our society as a basis for unfair advantage and inequity.",
        "Our concept of diversity generally focuses on “identity” as an organizing principle. UIC recognizes that people develop personal and collective identities based on the resonance that they perceive with various elements of their own background and the world around them. Our goal is that all of our students feel respected, fully empowered to be themselves in a welcoming environment, and, centrally to our purpose as an institution, prepared to thrive in the world of engineering.",
        "No matter who you are or where you come from, UIC is a place you can call home.",
