        "CUPPA students and alumni are uniquely skilled to build and transform sustainable urban neighborhoods and communities and to address the challenges presented in the 21st century. CUPPA’s top ranked accredited academic departments feature over 500 students studying a broad scope of undergraduate degrees along side two professional accredited graduate programs in Public Administration and Urban Planning and Policy.",
        "All of our UPP graduate degrees are STEM classified under Sustainability Studies which means that international students with F-1 visas are eligible to remain in the US under the OPT (Optional Practical Training) program for up to three years and two months after graduation. Students with H-1b visas can stay up to 9 years after graduation."
