        "The goal of the program is to pair UIC engineering junior or senior students with experienced UIC engineering alumni  for an exchange of information on education, professionalism, aspirations, ideas and professional connections! These pairings provide a learning experience for students outside the classroom, where they have a chance to see the opportunities that a professional environment has in store for them and for students to start growing their professional network.",
        "Here are some inspiring ways you can impact a UIC engineering student:",

        "Please reach out to the Program Manager: Eliana Riley, Assistant Director, Engineering Career Center at eliana@uic.edu",
        "“The most important take away for me was seeing the work my mentor does and hearing about his work. School on its own would not have shown me what project management or design building could be.” ~Kitty, Senior, Civil Eng. (Featured in the photo with her mentor)",
        "",
        "“My mentor has given a lot of insight in all the questions I have been asking. We mostly talk about school stuff and research.” ~Danilo, Senior, Computer Eng.",
        "“My mentor has been great. We had phone conversations once every couple of weeks and he gave me excellent advice regarding school, projects, and finding a job. I even got a tour of his work place and what they do.” ~Xiong, Senior, Electrical Eng.",
        "“I received a plethora of advice regarding the real world and the experiences encountered by my mentor that has, quite honestly, helped me immensely. His experience regarding graduate school helped me to open my eyes at the possibility of going myself. I am immensely fortunate to have spoken to such a humble and wise individual.”   ~Brandon, Senior, Mechanical Eng.",
        "Don’t sell yourself short when it comes to the power and value of mentorship: What may be obvious or second nature to you after years of experience may be transformational to someone who is just beginning their journey."
