        "Chemical engineering answers the question of what chemistry can do to improve the world around us. Chemical engineers are problem-solvers who take raw materials and turn them into useful materials. Our undergraduate program includes a thorough immersion in the core concepts of chemistry—general, organic, physical, and analytical—followed by a series of upper-level chemical engineering courses that develop your ability to apply these concepts to develop new, innovative solutions to engineering problems.",
        "The coursework in our program culminates in the Senior Design course, in which student teams, working with industry mentors, put their knowledge to work on a real-world issue that matters to them. Recent projects have focused on creating biofuels from wood chips, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by using chemical solvents to capture carbon dioxide, and meeting an increasing global demand for the chemical propylene. Senior Design projects offer a true opportunity to pick a cause you are passionate about and spend two semesters working on it—and the experience often proves valuable when applying for full-time jobs.",
        "UIC chemical engineering also is home to a concentration in biochemical engineering, which is of particular interest to students who love not only chemistry, but also biology. This concentration helps to position students for jobs or further study at the intersection of bioengineering and chemical engineering.",
        "Chemical engineering majors complete coursework in four categories:",
        "UIC offers a concentration in biochemical engineering for students who want to add an additional layer of specificity to their degree. This option is ideal for students who have an interest in biology or medicine, or for students who envision themselves working with applications of chemical engineering that can have a positive impact on medical treatment and the human body.",
        "Students who choose this concentration complete CHE 422 Biochemical Engineering as their technical elective. In addition, their free elective plus one additional free elective must come from this list:",
        "Because students in the biochemical engineering concentration must choose two free electives, this may elevate the number of credit hours required for the degree to 130 rather than the standard 128 for the chemical engineering major.",
        "As part of our accreditation process, ABET asks our department to capture the overall goals of the chemical engineering program. These are called our educational program objectives. They are:",
        "Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires the department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes.",
        "Students graduating from the chemical engineering program at UIC will have:",
        "In the 2019-2020 academic year, 265 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as chemical engineering majors across all class years. The department graduated 60 chemical engineering majors in the academic year ending May 2019."
