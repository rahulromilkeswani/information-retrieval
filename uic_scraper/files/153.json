        "Peter Nelson was appointed Dean of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s (UIC) College of Engineering in 2008. Prior to assuming his deanship, Professor Nelson was head of the UIC Department of Computer Science. In 1991, Professor Nelson founded UIC’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which specializes in applied intelligence systems projects in fields such as transportation, manufacturing, bioinformatics and e-mail spam countermeasures.",
        "Professor Nelson has published more than 80 scientific peer-reviewed papers and has been the principal investigator on over $40 million in research grants and contracts on issues of importance such as computer-enhanced transportation systems, manufacturing, design optimization, and bioinformatics. These projects have been funded by organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Department of Transportation and Motorola. In 1994-1995, Professor Nelson’s laboratory, sponsored by the Illinois Department of Transportation, developed the first real-time traffic congestion map on the World Wide Web, which now receives more than 100 million hits per year.",
        "Professor Nelson received his undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science from North Park University and his MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Northwestern University."
