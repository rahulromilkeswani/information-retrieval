        "Ever hear the word arduino thrown around amongst your CS friends. Have you seen people working in the CS Area with Leds and what looks like a processor and wonder what they are doing? Have you ever wondered what in the world is a Raspberry Pi? Come stop by SIG Micro and find out. We are a sig focused on learning about microcontrollers such as arduinos, Intel Galileos, and Raspberry Pi's(when used as microcontrollers). We will be doing various projects throughout the semester using arduinos.",
