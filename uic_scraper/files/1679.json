        "Dr. Seyoung An is currently working as a Research Scientist and Lab Manager within the Nanotechnology Core Facility (NCF) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He was born in South Korea and received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Korea University in 2005. His Ph. D. thesis focused on 2D Focal Plan Arrays (FPA) and the fabrication of HgCdTe grown by MOCVD for infrared detectors and camera applications. After his graduate studies, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Microphysics Lab of the University of Illinois at Chicago and continued to study infrared detector fabrication and applications. In 2008, he joined the NCF as a College of Engineering Research Scientist and was promoted to Lab Manager in 2011."
