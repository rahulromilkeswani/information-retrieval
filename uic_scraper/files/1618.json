        "Undergraduate students can complete a minor in computer engineering or a minor in electrical engineering at UIC. These minors can be useful for students who are pursuing a wide range of disciplines. For math or science students in UIC’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, for example, an ECE-based minor can be a springboard to understanding the practical applications of key theories. UIC Business students who have an interest in the tech industry or startups can use a computer engineering or electrical engineering minor to delve into the technology behind the products and services they plan to produce or manage.",
        "Use the links below to explore the requirements for the CE and EE minors. Please note that these requirements are for students outside of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. College of Engineering students should consult the undergraduate office or an academic advisor to learn how the CE and EE minor requirements pertain to them."
