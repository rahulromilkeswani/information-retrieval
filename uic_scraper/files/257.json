        "My main area of research is Natural Language Processing (NLP), and its application to human-computer interaction, educational technology, health care, human-robot interaction, and multimedia systems. My goal is to use NLP to support both education and instruction, and collaboration between human or artificial agents. The theoretical aspects of my research concern the linguistic analysis, and the knowledge representation and reasoning that support the understanding and generation of NL discourse and dialogue. All my research has its empirical foundations in both qualitative and quantitative corpus analysis, including data mining techniques.",
        "I enjoy a bit of everything, including exploring Chicago, movies, music (opera, classical, jazz), hiking, travelling, and spending time with my husband and two kids (18 and 15 years old).",
