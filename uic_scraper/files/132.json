    "text": [
        "Undergraduate seniors in engineering have the chance each year to show their creativity, ingenuity, and innovative spirit to the entire UIC community—and the city of Chicago.",
        "For most students, the road to Expo begins in the Senior Design course, a two-semester sequence that allows seniors to gather all the knowledge and skills they’ve acquired at UIC Engineering and put them to work to solve a real-world design problem.",
        "The projects our seniors take on range from the practical to the fantastic. Recent projects have explored creating biodiesel from coffee grounds, building devices to improve surgery, designing an HVAC system for a four-story building, conducting traffic analyses for Chicago’s major highways, and recommending musical selections for people via facial-recognition technology.",
        "Seniors enter their projects into the annual Engineering Expo, a conference-style event where students showcase their work to peers, faculty members, and panels of judges who represent Chicago’s professional community. Beginning in 2019, computer science students also take part in Expo, exhibiting work they completed using Arduino.",
        "All Expo information for current students—details about developing your proposal, conducting research and development, building your project, printing your poster, and more—are housed in our Expo student portal. Use the link below to access the portal (with your UIC password)."
