        "The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts is a unique group of schools and affiliated units dedicated to the investigation, creation, and interpretation of our physical, social, and sensory environments. With degree programs in the visual arts, design, theatre and music, architecture, and art history, the college is the only place in Chicago where one can prepare for a career in the arts and design within a major research university. The college is home to an energetic, award-winning faculty of practicing architects, artists, designers, museum professionals, art historians, musicians, directors, and theatrical performers. Through their instruction and ongoing research, the faculty introduces students to disciplinary and professional themes of contemporary importance and fosters a vibrant atmosphere of intellectual and creative inquiry.",
        "The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts is a leader in visual and performing arts and design education and research in the city of Chicago, the nation, and the world. The college considers its location in Chicago—a world-class cultural center, and a site of complex social realities—a primary asset. It has developed partnerships with significant local museums, theaters, firms, and other cultural institutions, as well as collaborations with a wide range of programs across the university. UIC’s status as an urban public institution drives the college’s interest in engaging urban issues and providing access to excellence in the arts and design to diverse audiences.",
        "From this setting, the college also advances a global agenda: to break ground in the arts and arts research and to generate new knowledge, informed by both historical precedent and the use of new technologies for expression and instruction. The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts extends the traditional boundaries of research and practice in order to meet the challenges of a changing economy. Faculty and students alike realize that the next generation of graduates must be equipped to operate creatively and knowledgeably in a broadening cultural arena and to think with an international perspective. To that end, the college has attracted a number of internationally recognized faculty and developed student exchange programs in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, The Netherlands, Mexico, Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland.",
        "The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts is comprised of the School of Architecture, the School of Art & Art History, the School of Design, and the School of Theatre & Music, as well as the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, a National Historic Landmark and museum committed to social justice, and Gallery 400, a dynamic, cutting edge contemporary art gallery. Curricula are offered in architecture, art, art history, design, interdisciplinary education in the arts, and theatre and music, leading to the baccalaureate in those fields. The core of the architecture programs is the intensive development of design work and ideas in the studio, supported by courses in architectural theory and technology. Art and art history emphasize social and global awareness and contemporary conceptual inquiry through both visual and scholarly production. Located in the School of Art & Art History, the IDEAS (Interdisciplinary Education in the Arts) BA offers students a degree linking all the arts through practice-based learning with an emphasis on emerging technology. Design programs develop sophisticated form-making skills in order to produce designers adept at formulating and advocating ideas. The School of Theatre & Music provides innovative, rigorous, and comprehensive academic and performance programs as part of its diverse, urban context.",
        "All work submitted by students for credit in any course in the college belongs to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois; the university reserves the right to retain, copyright, use, exhibit, reproduce, and publish any work so submitted.",
        "For information on the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, visit the college's website.",
        "Qualified graduates from the Bachelor of Science in Architecture program may apply for advanced standing in the school’s professional Master of Architecture degree program, or at other accredited schools of architecture. The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Master of Architecture program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). Master’s degree programs may consist of a preprofessional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, which, when earned sequentially, comprise an accredited professional education. Although oriented to NAAB criteria, UIC’s undergraduate preprofessional degree is not an accredited professional degree.",
        "To earn a College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts degree from UIC, students need to complete university, college, and department/school degree requirements. University and college degree requirements for all College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts students are outlined below. Students should consult their department or school section for additional degree requirements.",
        "The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts semester hour requirement varies by degree program.",
        "General Education at UIC is designed to serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. Students are required to complete a minimum of 24 semester hours in the General Education Core with at least one course from each of the following categories:",
        "For a description and a list of courses for each General Education Core category, students should consult the General Education section of the catalog. Information on meeting the General Education Core requirements for each degree program is provided in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts school sections.",
        "College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts students meet the requirement by achieving a passing grade in ENGL 160 and ENGL 161.",
        "The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts requires all new incoming freshmen in the college to complete DLG 120. DLG 120 is an 8-week, 1-semester-hour course focusing on diversity and dialogue.",
        "Each school and department in the college has a different set of foundation and major course requirements. Students must fulfill all the foundation and major course requirements outlined for their degree program.",
        "Each school or department in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts has specific upper-level requirements for their degree programs. Students should consult the individual unit for details on required 200-, 300-, or 400-level course work.",
        "Course work that duplicates previous credit does not count toward graduation; no credit is given for a course in which a failing grade is received.",
        "Credit earned in ENGL 060, ENGL 070, ENGL 071, MATH 088, and MATH 090 will not fulfill college degree requirements. (By exception, students may earn 3 semester hours of credit in ENGL 070 and ENGL 071 and receive a waiver of ENGL 160 for the term in which they receive written authorization from the Department of English.)",
        "Students whose placement test results require taking several courses that carry no graduation credit should plan on additional terms of enrollment to complete the required curriculum. All courses are included, however, for determining a student’s full-time/part-time status; for computing cumulative grade point averages (except for 000-level courses); and in determining probation, dismissal, and Dean’s List statuses.",
        "The university, college, school, and department degree requirements may not provide all the hours required for graduation. The remaining credits are completed through elective courses, whose careful selection should serve to enrich students’ knowledge and understanding. Elective courses should always be chosen for educational ends and not for the sake of convenience.",
        "Students in the college are expected to carry a full-time load in order to make satisfactory progress toward their degree. Students should consult with their academic advisor if they enroll in a part-time schedule to determine their degree progress and projected graduation date.",
        "College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts students cannot graduate with less than a 2.00/4.00 GPA in all work taken at UIC, in all work taken in the major field, and in all work accepted for transfer by the university (transfer work plus work taken at UIC).",
        "Students who are within two terms of graduation should contact the Office of Student Affairs for a complete check of their progress toward the degree. A diploma cannot be ordered until a student has completed this graduation check.",
        "Students declare their intent to graduate online using my.UIC. The deadline for submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will be made following the close of the term. If a student has satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student’s name will be placed on the official degree list.",
        "Either the first 90 or last 30 semester hours of degree work must be completed in continuous, uninterrupted enrollment residence at UIC. Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another collegiate institution or enrollment during the summer at another institution, when approved by the student’s college, does not interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement for graduation. Students who transfer from an accredited community college must earn at least 60 semester hours at an approved four-year institution and must meet the enrollment residence requirement of earning the last 30 semester hours at UIC.",
        "No more than 60 semester hours (90 quarter hours) of credit may be accepted as transfer work from a community or junior college. Transfer students from community or junior colleges should consult with an advisor in the CADA Office of Student Affairs to discuss transfer credit. All final acceptance of transfer credit will be determined by the college upon review of recommendations by the school or department.",
        "Continuing students in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts must submit a petition to the Office in order to take courses at other universities for credit toward the baccalaureate degree.",
        "During the fall and spring semesters, a full-time program is from 12 to 18 hours. Above 18 semester hours is considered an overload and may only be taken if a student is recommended by a school or department advisor and approved in the Office of Student Affairs. For Summer Session 1 (Four-Week) and Summer Session 2 (Eight-Week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6 semester hours as the minimum number necessary to constitute full-time enrollment, and a program of more than 14 hours must be approved.",
        "Academic Probation. A student whose term grade point average or UIC cumulative grade point average or combined UIC and transfer grade point average is below 2.00/4.00 is placed on academic probation and advised to enroll full-time for a minimum of 12 semester hours of credit and earn grades of B or better the next term in residence, excluding the summer session. Students unable to maintain a minimum of 12 semester hours of enrollment should consult with a college advisor to establish a plan for satisfactory progress. Probationary status is determined by letter grades earned at the end of any term. Grades of I (Incomplete) do not exempt a student from probationary and dismissal regulations.",
        "Terminal Probation. A student who is on probationary status for two consecutive terms is placed on terminal probation. The student is required to make an appointment to see an advisor in the college office during the third and fourth weeks of the following semester. Students on terminal probation may be dismissed for poor academic progress and are jeopardizing their enrollment in the university.",
        "A student on academic or terminal probation may be dismissed from the university under one of the following conditions:",
        "Students should follow the advice in the letter sent to them.",
        "Undergraduate students may drop courses using my.UIC through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop courses with the permission of their major college. If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program. College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts students must complete a request form in the Office of Student Affairs.",
        "Students wishing to change majors within the college should consult an advisor and complete an application in the Office of Student Affairs.",
        "Students are expected to attend all lectures, discussions, and laboratory/studio sessions. School or department faculty may establish minimum attendance requirements and penalties for nonattendance.",
        "No student may be admitted to a closed course in the college unless the director or chairperson has approved an increase in capacity, which is usually restricted by educational policies, budget, and maximum room capacities.",
        "Course prerequisites are listed in both the Undergraduate Catalog and the semester Schedule of Classes. Only the director or chairperson may waive a prerequisite, if given evidence that the student is adequately prepared to pursue the subject area.",
        "Students may elect to take a course under the credit/no credit option according to the following provisions:",
        "While a student may begin taking courses in the degree at any time, a student must declare a degree no later than the completion of 60 semester hours. To declare a degree, the student should consult an academic advisor in the Office of Student Affairs.",
        "This option is not available in the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts.",
        "A student may receive two degrees concurrently from the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts. The student must complete a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit beyond the requirements of the first degree in courses not offered for the first degree. The student must additionally meet all the requirements for the second degree specified by the college and the major. Students seeking double degrees should contact the appropriate school or department for a curriculum evaluation and then make a declaration for double degrees in the college office.",
        "Students who have already earned a bachelor’s degree from UIC or another institution may receive a second bachelor’s degree from the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts. Students seeking a second bachelor’s degree must formally apply to the program. The student must complete a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit beyond the requirements of the first degree in courses not offered for the first degree. The student must additionally meet all the requirements for the second degree.",
        "Students in the college are expected to carry a full-time load in order to make satisfactory progress toward their degree. Students should consult with their academic advisor if they enroll part-time to determine the consequences to their degree program and projected graduation date.",
        "With school or department approval, an undergraduate student may enroll in a course in the Graduate College (500-level) for undergraduate elective credit. Students should obtain approval prior to enrollment.",
        "Students should understand, however, that graduate courses do not automatically apply toward an undergraduate degree. Additionally, graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate student are generally not applicable toward a graduate degree.",
        "The college offers courses entitled Independent Study, in which a student’s special interests may be pursued under the direction of a faculty member. To enroll in such a course, the student must obtain consent of the instructor and the school or department offering the course.",
        "Any rule, regulation, or action of the college may be appealed through the use of a student petition. Petitions are available in the Office of Student Affairs. It is the student’s responsibility to obtain all necessary approvals on the form before submitting it to the Office of Student Affairs for review. Turning in the form does not guarantee approval of the request. Students will be notified of a decision, but they should inquire about the status of their petition after ten working days.",
        "Students interested in earning proficiency credit should contact the school or department directly for information concerning eligibility. A student who earns proficiency credit is given the amount of credit toward graduation regularly allowed in the course. Proficiency credit is not considered an interruption of enrollment residence for graduation, nor does it apply toward satisfying the minimum requirement of the degree if the last 30 semester hours must be earned in enrollment residence.",
        "Students must consult with an academic advisor for registration. An advising hold may be be placed on each registration and will only be released upon verification of semester advising.",
        "Students may repeat a course to increase their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under which repeating a course is advisable and to a student’s advantage. There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage a student and narrow a student’s options. Some colleges require students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic advisor before they register to repeat the course.",
        "Courses with A or B grades may not be repeated. Normally, courses with a C grade may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. The original grade and the grade for each repeat will be calculated into the grade point average.",
        "Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.",
        "To repeat a course more than once requires written permission from the student’s college dean. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should consult their college before repeating a course.",
        "UIC students interested in admission to one of the degree offered in the college must complete an intercollegiate application available in the Office of Student Affairs. All applicants must be in good standing, not on academic probation or undetermined status. Eligibility varies by department and school.",
        "Admission to the college is selective and competitive and admissions standards are higher than the minimum grade point average requirement.",
        "The minimum transfer grade point average for admission to the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts varies with each school or department. All admission decisions are final due to the demand for space in all programs. Students should refer to the requirements listed for each program.",
        "School of Architecture: BS in Architecture.

Applicants wishing to apply for advanced placement must submit a portfolio of design work to the academic advisor in the school. More information on the portfolio requirement is available online.",
        "Advanced placement is a competitive process that is limited to spaces available in the level of program appropriate for the transfer student. Acceptance into the school does not guarantee advanced placement. See the Office of Admissions Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.",
        "School of Architecture: BA in Architectural Studies. The program will admit undergraduate students having completed two years of college, either at UIC or at other institutions. In all transferrable course work, applicants must earn a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.75/4.00 and at least 60 semester hours at time of enrollment in order to be considered for admission.

        "Admission to the Department of Art History is selective and competitive; admissions standards are typically higher than the stated minimum grade point average. See the Office of Admissions Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.",
        "School of Design. Students who have taken art and design courses at a community college should be aware that these courses will be credited as electives only.
