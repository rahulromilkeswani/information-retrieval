        "In individual therapy, you work one-on-one with a counselor to address your concerns. Our counselors are good listeners, they can be a source of support and understanding, and they will help you explore your options and develop effective strategies to cope with your concerns.",
        "",
        "The Counseling Center utilizes a short-term model for counseling, meaning that issues usually are addressed in a focused manner over the course of no more than one semester. If you have a history of long-term or concurrent individual therapy, your initial consultation counselor will likely refer you to a community provider who can work with you on a longer-term basis. If you and your initial consultation counselor have determined that brief counseling at our Counseling Center is right for you, you and your assigned counselor will discuss your goals for therapy, frequency of sessions, and likely length of treatment to address your concerns.",
        "Many students consider individual counseling to be the most effective form of counseling. However, if your concerns are related to interpersonal dynamics (relationship problems, communication concerns, social anxiety, etc.), you may be referred to one of our therapy groups. Group therapy is the most effective treatment for such concerns and offers students a place to examine and improve their relationship dynamics in a safe, confidential group environment.
