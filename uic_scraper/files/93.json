    "title": "UIC to hold virtual graduation celebration | UIC Today",
    "text": [
        "The celebration is not a replacement for the traditional UIC commencement ceremony, which will be rescheduled once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and health officials have deemed it is safe for public gatherings to resume.",
        "En español",
        "The university has teamed up with Marching Order, a private company that allows an opportunity for educational institutions to provide a tailored virtual graduation ceremony. At UIC, 14 of the university’s 16 colleges will share information about their graduates onto the Marching Order site through links that will be able to be shared by the graduates themselves. These include the UIC John Marshall Law School as well as the Honors College.",
        "The College of Medicine will have its own virtual celebration on May 8 so that they can begin working in the health field as soon as possible. Students in the Graduate College will participate in their academic college’s online ceremonies.",
        "Of the 5,381 total graduates participating, 3,149 will earn undergraduate degrees while 2,232 will receive graduate/advanced degrees. The largest number of graduates are from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, followed by the College of Engineering and College of Nursing.",
        "“We are very proud of our graduates,” UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis said. “We will confer their degrees in a virtual ceremony so that they can move on with the next phase of their careers. And while we will celebrate virtually this milestone, I view it as a dress rehearsal for the face-to-face celebration that everyone wants to participate in and one that our graduates, their families and their friends deserve. When it is safe to do so, I’m sure that everyone in the class of 2020 will join us for a real celebration on campus.”",
        "Until then, graduates and their families will be able to view congratulatory messages from the chancellor as well as commencement speakers during the May 16 virtual event. The links will go live at 9 a.m. and be viewable afterward. Commencement speakers include:",
        "Prior to May 16, graduates will have the opportunity to upload a photo on a slide which will list their names, major and a personal message. The page listing the names of the students and other private information will be available through a link to the graduate, who will be able to share it.",
        "The ceremony with commencement speeches will be open to the public, including the media.",
