        "UIC will consider sponsorship for tenured, tenured track, or clinical  discipline track appointments. In addition, Academic Professional  positions (non-tenure track and non-teaching) will be considered for  immigrant visa sponsorship only when the appointment titles are either  Research Assistant Professor or Research Associate Professor and they  meet the special circumstances as described below in section B of the  criteria. Under exceptional circumstances the Dean’s office in  collaboration with the Office of International Services may make limited  exceptions to this policy. Exceptional circumstances are considered to  exist when long-term services of an employee are deemed to be in the  best interest of the University and would serve to further the  University’s mission.",
        "No UIC department or individual should promise current or prospective  employees that the University will obtain permanent residence on their  behalf. The decision to file such an application must be made by the  appropriate hiring authority in consultation with OIS. The “green card”  process is lengthy, involving up to three government agencies, and the  final decision to grant permanent residence must be made at the United  States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). It is never a  certainty that permanent residency will be approved, and therefore  should not be promised as an enticement benefit for employment.",
        "All costs associated with filing of the employer-based immigrant  petition (I-140) will be paid by the sponsoring department. Under no  circumstances should the foreign national be asked to reimburse the  “sponsoring department”. Note, it is the beneficiary’s responsibility  and at their own expense, to file the necessary documents for adjustment  (I-485) or consular processing.",
        "The Office of International Services is the sole authority for filing  employment-based immigrant petitions, and any other employment-based  petitions on behalf of UIC. Any employment-based petition submitted  without prior authorization and signature of a designated representative  of the Office of International Services may result in a request by UIC  to the government for official withdrawal of the petition. The role of  OIS is limited to those aspects of the document preparation and  submission that are directly related to the University’s interests and  related to the University’s interests and responsibilities as an  employer.",
        "",
        "United  States immigration laws provide for three employment-based “preference”  categories applicable to work at UIC. The purpose of these categories  is to make possible sponsorship of employment for foreign nationals by  the U.S. employers on a permanent basis. These categories define what  must be presented by a sponsoring employer such as UIC to the United  States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in order to obtain  approval of employment0based immigrant petitions. The OIS will meet with  the foreign national sponsoring UIC department representatives in order  to evaluate the individual’s qualifications and the job to be filled,  and thereby determine which of the three categories will be used to  pursue the employment-based immigrant visa. The three available  preference categories are:",
        "",
        "An employment-based immigrant visa petition (green card) involves at least a two-part process:",
        "",
        "The  Office of International Services will use the following criteria when  evaluating requests for employment-based immigrant visa sponsorship:",
        "Note, all Second Preference and Third Preference cases require  an additional stage in the green card process known as the labor  certification application. OIS will file the required application in the  U.S. Department of Labor’s PERM system as part of the immigrant visa  process. However, approval of labor certification must occur prior to  filing of the I-140 immigrant visa petition.",
