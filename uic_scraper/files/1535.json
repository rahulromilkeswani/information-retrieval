        "Developing professional connections (aka networking) is part of a successful job search strategy. Building a strong network of professional contacts now will help you throughout your career! But before you start networking, you should develop your own professional introduction (elevator pitch) to you can use when meeting other professionals so you are ready to share who you are and what you have to offer!",
        "Click here to develop your professional introduction (elevator pitch) in 5 steps!",
        "Networking is simply a word to describe connecting with people in your chosen professional field. It’s a process of developing professional relationships that will help you grow your career.",
        "You probably network regularly without realizing it (e.g. speaking with professors about your career goals, meeting a recruiter at a career fair and following up with a LinkedIn connection request, or asking a friend’s parent who’s also an engineer about how they got into engineering).",
        "Not at all! Most working professionals have obtained at least one job or internship through networking. Engineers and other professionals have been in your shoes before, and some will be happy to help you. Not everyone will be receptive or have time to help, though. If one person can’t help, find someone else who can.",
        "Your network is a lot bigger than you think. Anybody you have ever met is part of your network, including but not limited to:",
        "You can network at real-time events (including career fairs, trade shows, networking-focused happy hour events, student org meetings, Career Center employer events) or virtually over email and LinkedIn. Check out events both on- and off-campus to talk to people who are working in your desired field(s).",
