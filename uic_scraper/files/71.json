        "At UIC, researchers have the tools they need",
        "The University of Illinois at Chicago provides researchers with access to a wide range of opportunities, resources and up-to-date research tools to support their work, promote multidisciplinary collaboration and inspire new ideas.",
        "UIC’s Research Resources Center (RRC) provides the UIC research community with a broad inventory of high-end scientific equipment and a wide range of services within its research support units and 17 cores. Together the units and cores employ personnel with extensive skill sets in various scientific protocols who are able to assist or execute research projects.",
        "The RRC maintains fully-calibrated instruments, like next-generation sequencers, mass spectrometers, microscopes and cytometers, which are available to researchers along with training and troubleshooting support. RRC’s cores are divided into three divisions: Bioanalytics, Biophysics & Cytomics, Genome Research, and Scientific Imaging & Nanotechnology.",
        "Cancer. Children’s environmental health. Clinical and translational science. Wound healing and tissue regeneration. These are just a few of the UIC centers and programs focused on making human life better. Through collaboration with groups like the World Health Organization, discoveries made at UIC make a big impact on people around the globe.",
        "UIC students play a critical role in this work. They join faculty members, scientists and clinicians in conducting this groundbreaking research. These hands-on educational opportunities are open to students in liberal arts and sciences, public health, dentistry, nursing, medicine and more.",
        "The UIC Library supports  you during the entire research process: discovery, use, dissemination and archiving.",
        "UIC encourages research that changes lives. Many centers, labs and institutes at UIC promote collaboration across the sciences and humanities. The goal of these groups is to discover solutions to complex local, national and global concerns.",
        "The Institute for Health Research and Policy is the University of Illinois at Chicago’s incubator and home to research that spans health and social sciences to advance health and quality of life among all communities. The Institute sparks innovative UIC research by providing the services and infrastructure needed to develop research ideas, form collaborations and successful teams, and manage grants from proposal to closeout.",
        "At the Institute, faculty-investigators across the university belong to an intellectual community of researchers who influence policy, practice and the community by advancing science. The Institute mentors these investigators in advancing their research goals and provides resources, covering all aspects of research management, implementation, security and dissemination.",
        "The Center for Clinical and Translational Science is UIC’s hub for clinical and translational health research. The Center seeks to accelerate the process of turning scientific discoveries into new tools and treatments that help prevent disease and improve the health of our communities.",
        "Since 2008, the center has provided resources and services that support the health research efforts of faculty and students in the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing, Applied Health Sciences and Social Work, and the School of Public Health.",
        "The Institute for Environmental Science and Policy is a research center that promotes science in support of a sustainable future. Solutions to modern environmental problems facing society are increasingly national and global, and their complexity requires that many scholars work together.",
        "The Institute inspires discovery and interdisciplinary collaboration by teaming scholars with their counterparts in the public and private sectors to devise workable solutions for complex environmental challenges, particularly those problems unique to the urban environment.",
        "For more than 35 years, faculty and student research has been",
        "supported by the UIC Institute for the Humanities. Its fellowship",
        "program and research awards for faculty have led to major books and",
        "articles in the humanities. The Institute also gives humanities",
        "graduate students writing support and mentoring.",
        "The Institute supports a variety of conferences and working groups",
        "each year to encourage interdisciplinary research at UIC. Groups such",
        "as Health and Society, Political Ecologies, and Institutions link",
        "humanities scholars with researchers in the sciences, public health,",
        "and medicine.",
        "Recently the Institute launched a new series of “Frontiers Workshops”",
        "that focus on cutting edge issues in the humanities. These conferences",
        "bring UIC faculty together with visiting scholars to explore new",
        "questions, debates, and methodologies in the humanities. Further",
        "initiatives in Engaged Humanities and Digital Humanities offer new",
        "opportunities to enhance scholarship and teaching.",
        "",
        "Some data is best communicated through visuals.  The Urban Data Visualization Lab, part of the college of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, works with researchers throughout campus.  For faculty and students, the lab makes data visually understandable and more useful through mapping, geospatial data analysis, presentation formatting and data management.",
        "Researchers can visually find patterns in their data, present data in 3-D form, model spatial relationships, or compare their data with census data. Lab faculty and staff also teach courses in visualization and geographic information systems to provide students with valuable job skills.",
        "The Biologic Resources Laboratory manages the care of animals used in research and teaching in UIC’s fully-accredited Animal Care and Use Program. This includes making sure that UIC meets all government regulations and best practices in its treatment of animals. The professional staff of the lab includes five board-certified veterinarians and 40 animal care technicians; they are responsible for helping about 300 researchers, teaching graduate and technical courses, and directing the postdoctoral training program."
