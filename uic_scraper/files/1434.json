        "Society",
        "Alongside these engineering challenges, we face the challenge of preparing ourselves and fellow students for the professional world. Along the way, taking time to visit students in elementary school through high school to show the coming generation the opportunities that lie within programs like ours.",
        "Outreach",
        "We hold a great debt to the companies and programs that make these opportunities available to us through various contributions and dontations. Without these companies we would not get the chance to build these once-in-a-lifetime vehicles and help further our careers.",
