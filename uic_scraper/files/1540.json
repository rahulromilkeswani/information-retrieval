        "If you really want to increase your chances of hearing back on positions you applied for or hoping to build a better relationship with that person you met at a networking event, you must follow up! It is one of the most important part of your search process and will make you stand out from other candidates who are not following up. It also shows INITIATIVE on your part! When following up, make sure to clearly show your intentions confidently and not aggressively.",

        "",
        "Hi (Use name if possible or Hiring Manager),",
        "I hope you are having a great week. I recently applied for the (Position title) and I wanted to check in on your decision timeline. I am excited about the opportunity to work at (Company Name) and contribute my (specific skills the company is looking for) to your team.",
        "Please let me know if I can provide any additional information. I look forward to hearing from you regarding our next steps in the hiring process.",
        "Best,",
        "(Your Name)",
        "Hi (Person’s name),",
        "It was nice meeting you at (Name of event and date). I really enjoyed our conversation on (provide specific details from the conversation). Thank you for connecting with me on LinkedIn! Based on our conversation, is there anyone else within your network that you think I should connect with?",
        "Let me know if you would like to grab coffee sometime.",
        "Best,",
        "(Your Name)",
        "Hi (Person’s name),",
        "Thank you for taking the time to interview me yesterday for the (position title). It was great to learn more about the position, the company and meet such a cohesive team! I enjoyed our conversation on (provide something specific that was discussed). After learning more about the position, I am even more confident that my skills and experiences align with the role and your company, especially (provide a specific skill that relates to the position and company).",
        "Please let me know if you would like additional information. I look forward to hearing from you soon regarding our next steps.",

        "(Your Name)",
        "Sometimes it is hard to find the right person to follow up with at an employer you have submitted your resume to. This is where LinkedIn becomes a big help. You can find recruiters or hiring professionals who work at your target company and send them a follow-up message after you apply. As in all types of follow-up there is a proper approach to take in order to generate a response.",
        "You will not always be able to connect with recruiters or hiring personnel from the company you applied to.  Thankfully, UIC has a network of 150,000 alumni profiles on LinkedIn. Some of these alumni may work at organizations where you would like to become an intern or full-time employee. UIC alumni can be a great way to network your way into a company, before a job is even posted."
