    "text": [
        "To meet the growing demand in the field for highly skilled construction engineering managers, UIC civil and materials engineering launched this new master's degree program—the only one of its kind at a public university in the greater Chicago area.",
        "Our curriculum is comprehensively developed and specifically designed to encompass the knowledge base and skill set required in the present-day construction engineering and management profession. The program is geared for students who plan to rise into higher roles in construction management—those who not only execute the required work, but who have the capacity to lead teams and oversee projects.",
        "Contact us: Hossein Ataei, PhD, Program Director | Sara Arevalo, Graduate Coordinator",
        "This program is ideal for a wide range of professionals and recent college graduates who want to develop their technical knowledge and field-specific competencies.",
        "You may be a strong candidate for this new MS program if you are:",
        "Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university in an engineering field—for example, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, industrial engineering—or in mathematics or physics.",
        "Applicants must also demonstrate a satisfactory cumulative undergraduate GPA (grade point average) and satisfactory performance in previous coursework related to their major.",
        "When students complete the program requirements, we expect they will have comprehensive knowledge in these areas:",
        "The program director, Dr. Hossein Ataei, teaches the required core courses alongside colleagues from the Department of Civil and Materials Engineering.",
        "All lectures are delivered in classrooms on UIC’s east campus, just a few minutes outside the core of downtown Chicago. Our campus is accessible via the CTA blue line as well as a number of CTA bus routes. On-site parking is available for a fee, on either a daily basis or semester basis, for registered graduate students.",
        "Students have access to department and university computer labs, including a full suite of civil engineering software: AutoCAD and Civil 3D, the Autodesk Building Information Modeling package (REVIT, Navisworks, and BIM 360), ARC-GIS, HECRAS, the Microsoft Office and MS Project suites, and more.",
        "The MS in Construction Engineering and Management at UIC is a degree designed for professionals, and therefore your career advancement is paramount.",
