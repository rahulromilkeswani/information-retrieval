        "If English is not your native language, you might need to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the exam of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) or the PTE-Academic. Check out the International Requirements to see if this applies to you.",
        "Scores must be submitted to UIC directly using the institutional code 1851.",
