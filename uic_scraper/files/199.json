        "Getting Started",
        "Once you have accepted a TA position, you must request any changes to the TA appointment at least two weeks prior to the start of classes. Resigning the assistantship at the last minute or after the semester begins, or being unavailable for TA duties on the first day of classes, are unacceptable actions and will negatively affect future TA/TFW consideration.",
        "New international student TAs must pass the Oral Certification by the end of the first semester. Information on this certification is on the ITA website.",
        "Once your TA assignment has been finalized, you should contact the course instructor to introduce yourself. You should become familiar with the requirements of the course, the instructor’s needs, and the TA duties. Making this initial contact with the course instructor is essential, no matter whether you are working as a lab assistant, course assistant, or grader.",
        "The guide below will help you in gathering the information you need to be successful as a teaching assistant.",
        "Course information",
        "Your work responsibilities",
        "Important contacts",
        "If any teaching assistant, research assistant, TFW holder, or grader is caught in an act of cheating, plagiarism, making threats against any person with the intention of affecting academic performance, examination by proxy, grade tampering, or other acts of academic dishonesty, the consequences will be serious.",
        "A teaching assistant, research assistant, TFW holder, or grader in these circumstances will forfeit all financial aid from the department in that semester and any future consideration for financial aid from the department. If the financial aid is from another unit at UIC, your UIC employer will be informed in writing of any misconduct. A teaching assistant, research assistant, TFW holder, or grader in these circumstances may be dismissed from the university. Misconduct is taken very seriously.",
        "Mailboxes are not provided to any CS graduate students. If a class requires paper submission of assignments, the TA should notify CS Student Affairs for submission options. Faculty and staff mailboxes are located in the main office, 1120 SEO. If you want to drop off something for a faculty or staff member, visit the main office to locate the appropriate box. No personal mail should be sent to the department address. The department will NOT be responsible for any lost mail.",
        "We do our best to provide a TA office to all TAs, but we have limited space available. If you intend to use your lab space for office hours, contact your advisor to verify that this is acceptable and inform CS Student Affairs. No personal items, food, refrigerator, toasters, coffee machines, or other similar items should be stored in TA offices, which represent a shared space designed to help you fulfill your TA duties. The space must be kept clean and in good working order. It is your responsibility to ensure your students respect the office space."
