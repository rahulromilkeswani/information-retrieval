        "",
        "",
        "Qualifier Examination",
        "PhD students must pass the qualifier examination before the end of their fourth semester of enrollment. See the Qualifier Examination page for full details.",
        "Preliminary Examination",
        "PhD students must pass a preliminary examination on their proposed dissertation topic. In this examination, students must demonstrate a capacity for independent research on an original dissertation topic within the selected field of study. Visit the Preliminary Examination page for full details.",
        "Dissertation",
        "Upon completion of all degree requirements and the dissertation, students must orally defend their work before the committee. Visit the Dissertation Process page for full details.",
        "All PhD students are assigned a temporary advisor upon admission. Students are encouraged to choose a permanent advisor by their second semester. By the completion of the third semester, a formal Permanent Advisor selection form must be submitted to the CS Student Affairs office. Permanent advisors must be chosen by mutual agreement.",
        "All PhD students are required to complete the College of Engineering’s annual online self-assessment. Students are notified when the self-assessment is open and provided with the link. It requires demographic information, self-evaluation, publications, presentations, and plans for the upcoming year.  Once the student completes and submits the survey, the advisor receives a notification that allows him or her to verify and provide feedback on the student’s progress.",
        "The UIC College of Engineering strategic plan states that students in a PhD program who have received any financial support from UIC—such as a teaching assistantship, research assistantship, fellowship, or tuition and fee waiver—cannot transfer into any MS program in the College of Engineering, which includes computer science, without an approved petition.",
