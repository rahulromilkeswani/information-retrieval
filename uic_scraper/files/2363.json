See the OIS website for more information on F-1 Curricular Practical Training or J-1 Academic Training eligibility and application processes.

        "F-1 Optional Practical Training",
        "F-1 students planning to complete their programs during the spring 2020 semester should begin thinking about Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT). OPT applications are ideally submitted to United States Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) 90 days prior to the expected program completion date.

        "Required Reporting of Other Status or Academic Changes",

        "",
        "Address Updates",
