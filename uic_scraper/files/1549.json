        "UIC offers a unique opportunity to freshman engineering students. Conceived of and supported by the faculty and the dean of the College of Engineering, the Guaranteed Paid Internship Program (GPIP) gives incoming fall freshman students the opportunity to serve as paid interns during the summer months, providing they meet certain criteria by the end of their first year of study.",
        "Who is Eligible for GPIP?",
        "Freshman Engineering and Computer Science students who are directly admitted into the College of Engineering in the Fall of the academic year.",
        "The GPIP application will be available for the 2020-2021 academic year in fall 2020. Only new transfer and freshman students starting in the fall are eligible to apply.",
        "",
        "GPIP Eligibility Requirements",
        "GPIP FAQs",
        "We suggest that you apply to off-campus internships throughout the school year until you secure an internship. While we will be alerting you to internship opportunities you can apply to, we have had several students secure internships on their own through online searches and networking.",
        "We do our best to place students in a research lab within their department. However, depending on project availability, you may end up in a research lab at UIC outside of your department, but still engaging in engineering-related work.",
        "Due to COVID-19, the College of Engineering is adjusting the eligibility requirements of our GPIP program.  To see the original requirements for GPIP,  click here (for freshmen) or click here (for transfers).  Because students now have the option to take Credit/No Credit for any course this spring, the following changes have been made:",
        "We will know more in a few weeks, but currently it looks like most GPIP internships may need to be postponed until the next academic year or until summer of 2021. In a few weeks, when we expect to have more clarity about the prospects of being on campus this summer, our UIC Engineering research labs will be surveyed to see when they can host GPIP interns.  Some of the options currently being explored include:",
        "",
        "The above options are just an example and this list might change.  For example, if we are able to go forward with some summer 2020 internships these might be shortened from 8 weeks to 5 weeks to provide a later start. After we hear back from our research labs we will send an email to each student eligible for GPIP asking you to rank order your top three choices on when you would like to have your internship."
