        "Dear UIC family,",
        "We care about you. We know the spread of COVID-19 has led to a lot of changes in and outside of the University, and things can feel very uncertain and stressful – and you may have questions and need support. We are here for you.",
        "The Dean of Students Office will remain open and all of our staff are available to assist you. However, for everyone’s safety and to help flatten the curve, we are going to change a few of the ways that we operate. Starting Friday, March 20th, our physical office in 3030 SSB will be closed until further notice. If you need to reach us, please do so by phone at 312-996-4857 or email at dos@uic.edu and we can set up a virtual meeting with you.",
        "These changes will require some adjustments for us and for you, and we ask that you be patient as we adapt. If you reach out to us, know that we will get back to you as soon as we can.",
        "Three key points:",
        "As always, remember that the U and I Care program is here for you as a resource should you require additional support during this time.",
        "If you would like some additional information about how to keep yourself healthy and well during this time, our friends at the UIC Wellness Center have lots of tips and tools on their website.",
        "Please do what you can to stay healthy, care for yourself and care for one another. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support.",
        "Go Flames,",
        "Office of the Dean of Students",
        "The Office of the Dean of Students strives to be the campus leader in fostering a caring and supportive environment where all students matter. Through a variety of offices, including Student Assistance, Community Standards, Student Legal and Student Veterans, we assist students in resolving issues so they can focus on their academic and social development.",
        "The U and I Care Network is dedicated to the success of all UIC students. Through the Network’s partnerships with on-campus units, the Student Assistance area in the Office of the Dean of Students is able to provide additional resources and support as students navigate through personal challenges and hardships. This Network serves as an outreach and educational tool for the UIC community. Initiatives include Care Facts, Pop-ups, Summit, U and I Care Week, & the U and I Care Fund."
