    "text": [
        "Obtain Academic Program Approval",
        "Academic program approval of the thesis or dissertation consists of two parts:",
        "1. Advisor and Committee Approval",
        "Adviser/committee approval is indicated by the signed (A) Examination Report and (B) Committee Recommendation Forms.  Signatures from the committee are usually obtained at the end of the defense.  If the committee requests revisions or if the committee indicates a conditional pass on the Examination Report, the revisions most likely will result in a change in pagination or format.  Only after all required content revisions are completed and approved by the advisors/chair should you submit your thesis to the academic program thesis reviewer (unless that person has indicated they also wish to pre-review your document before the final version).",
        "2. Thesis Format Academic Program Reviewer",
        "After all revisions have been approved by your advisor/committee, you will need to submit your thesis to your program’s thesis format reviewer, who will ensure that the format of your thesis meets any departmental requirements. All programs have an assigned thesis reviewer. If you are unsure who the thesis reviewer for your program is, contact your Director of Graduate Studies or program support staff.  Note:  Programs may have different processes for the format review. The student should consult with the program staff or DGS before the defense to understand the processes in that program.",
        "Only after you have completed all revisions and corrections requested by your adviser/committee and your departmental thesis format reviewer are you ready to begin the ETD submission process.",
        "For graduation consideration for each academic term there is a deadline by which the thesis must be deposited with the Graduate College Thesis Office.  Thesis deadlines for current and future terms are listed on the Graduate College Academic Calendar.  The ETD and all required deposit materials must be submitted to the Graduate College Thesis Office no later than 4:30 p.m. on the day of the deadline.",
        "If a thesis needs to be temporarily withheld from public release because there is material in the thesis that is protected by or could potentially be protected by a patent, the student should submit a Thesis Withholding Request Form to the Office of Technology Management before submitting the thesis for review to the Graduate College.",
        "Update your address information in UIC Self-Service",
        "Diplomas are mailed to graduates approximately 9 weeks after the end of the term.  To ensure delivery of the diploma to the correct location, students should enter a “Diploma Address” in your Self-Service account. If there is no “Diploma Address” recorded, the diploma will be sent to your “Mailing Address.”  The Diploma Address may be updated in Self-Service up to three weeks after the end of the term.  After that, contact the Records Office to change the Diploma Address.",
        "UIC Email Account",
        "Your UIC Net ID and email account (i.e. yournetID@uic.edu) remains active for two terms after the term of graduation.  The account may expire earlier if you were not registered the term of official graduation, but will be reactivated post-graduation for two terms.",
        "Submit an Intent to Graduate",
        "Students must submit an online Intent to Graduate no later than the end of the third week (second week of the eight week summer session) of the term of intended graduation.  If, for any reason, you do not graduate that term and new Intent to Graduate must be submitted for the next term of intended graduation.",
        "Participate in Commencement",
        "Participation in the commencement ceremony is voluntary, but you are encouraged to attend.  Commencement ceremonies for Summer and Fall graduates occur in December, and for Spring graduates in May. For information about participation in the campus wide ceremonies and convocations sponsored by colleges and schools see the Commencement website.",
        "Obtain Bound Copies of the Thesis for Personal Use",
        "The copy or copies of the thesis that you deposit with the Thesis Office become the property of the University of Illinois. Theses and dissertations submitted electronically will be made available through UIC Indigo, according to the release option chosen at the time of submission.",
        "The Thesis Office does not provide or distribute thesis copies to students, departments, or anyone else. If you want to have copies of your thesis bound for yourself, your family, or your adviser, you will need to procure them independently.  Options Include:",
        "The ETD submission system you will use to submit your thesis is the result of a partnership between the Graduate College and the University’s digital repository for research and scholarship, UIC Indigo. After your thesis has been approved by the Graduate College Thesis Office, it will become available in UIC Indigo according to the release option you choose during submission.",
        "To begin your ETD submission, your thesis should be formatted according to Graduate College thesis requirements and approved by your department.",
        "After you have submitted your ETD online for review, you will receive a series of emails from the Graduate College Thesis Office that will notify you that we have received your ETD and alert you to any required corrections or other steps you will need to take to complete your thesis deposit. You may also check the status of our review of your ETD, including final approval, at any time by returning to your submission profile via the link provided below.",
        "Your thesis deposit is not complete until you have made all corrections requested by the Graduate College Thesis Office and have submitted all additional materials required for the deposit.  Additional material (e.g. Survey of Earned Doctorates, etc.) that is required must be submitted by the submission deadline.  Any format corrections required by the Graduate College Thesis Office must be received by the date provided by the Graduate College reviewer.  (Note: The deadline given for any corrections to the ETD submitted to the Graduate College is not the same as the final submission deadline.)"
