        "Engineering is an application of scientific principles to solve real-world problems. Engineering physicists are engaged more deeply on the scientific end than most.",
        "With UIC’s engineering physics major, you will develop a command of physics that will make you especially competitive in roles that require an understanding of science and theory, such as research and development positions.",
        "Engineering physics majors take nine physics courses. After completing General Physics I (which focuses on mechanics) and General Physics II (which is about electricity and magnetism), EP majors delve the scientific method, quantum theory, waves, thermal physics, quantum and theoretical mechanics, experimental physics, and other topics.",
        "If scientific inquiry—the research that will fuel the next generation of engineering advances—is your area of interest, an engineering physics major is a rewarding choice.",
        "The UIC course catalog lays out all of the degree requirements for the EP major. The overview below gives a survey of what you can expect.",
        "Engineering physics majors complete coursework in four categories:",
        "The ECE department has identified groups of courses that can help guide your academic planning based on the areas of electrical and computer engineering in which you seek to specialize. You can find descriptions of each track and its associated courses on this page.",
        "As part of our accreditation process, ABET asks our department to capture the overall goals of the electrical and computer engineering programs. These are called our educational program objectives. Within a few years of graduation, our talented graduates will:",
        "Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires the department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes.",
        "Students graduating from the electrical engineering, computer engineering, and engineering physics programs at UIC will have:",
        "In the 2019-2020 academic year, 20 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as engineering physics majors across all class years. The department graduated three engineering physics majors in the academic year ending May 2019."
