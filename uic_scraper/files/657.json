Student employees who are unable to work remotely should still continue to get paid for the remainder of the Spring semester until May 16, 2020 (BW11). The employing unit supervisor should be in touch to discuss whether the student’s job responsibilities as well as their current personal circumstances make remote work feasible. If student employees have specific questions, they should contact their employing unit supervisor.",
