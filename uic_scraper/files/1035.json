        "We are quickly approaching a pivotal moment in the life of our community. The City of Chicago’s municipal election will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 26. This is an opportunity for you to let your voice be heard as you vote for the candidate(s) that best represent you.

As Chicago’s public research university, it is our responsibility to keep the momentum going.",
