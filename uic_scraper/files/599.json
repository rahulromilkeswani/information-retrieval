    "text": [
        "As noted by Chancellor Amiridis, our goal at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is to “provide the broadest access to the highest levels of intellectual excellence.” Such intellectual excellence is only within our reach when individual students commit to pursuing their education with the utmost honesty.",
        "Academic integrity, a foundational element of all educational communities, is the value underpinning everything we do at UIC. It encompasses many behaviors, but the core idea is when you choose any action one might construe as “an unfair or undeserved academic advantage1”, you undermine your learning, your goals, and your relationships within the UIC community. For a complete list of UIC’s Academic Integrity standards, please reference section IV.A. of the Student Disciplinary Policy.",
        "1deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct",
        "College is often the time when students solidify their values around academic integrity. Explore this page to learn more about: the importance of academic integrity; information about responding to alleged academic misconduct; resources to avoid academic violations; and common sanctions given when students are found responsible.",
        "Faculty are crucial partners in every step of our efforts to create a strong culture of academic integrity at UIC. From syllabus statements to misconduct reporting, learn more here about support available for faculty and staff, plus some of the research-backed steps you can take to encourage academic integrity on campus."
