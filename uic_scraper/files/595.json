    "text": [
        "Students will often look to faculty and staff to lend a helping hand or be good listeners. Your initial response should be one of interest and concern. This may play an extremely important role in helping a struggling student find the appropriate assistance. Any situation where the safety of the student or others is in question should be referred to UIC Police by calling (312) 355-5555. You may also contact the Counseling Center or the Office of the Dean of Students at (312) 996-4857 to consult with a licensed counselor or a staff member.",
        "Below is some helpful information to aid you in identifying a student in distress and developing a helpful response with the goal of getting him or her to the appropriate resources.",
        "A student in distress may be reluctant or unable to acknowledge a need for personal help. The student may exhibit certain behaviors such as:",
        "Disruptive behavior can assume many forms. It may be:",
        "It is important to differentiate disruptive behavior (which directly interferes with the ability of an instructor to teach, the ability of other students to benefit from the classroom experience, or your ability to conduct business in an office) from behavior that is merely rude or uncivil. While the latter may become disruptive when it is repetitive or persistent, it usually is best addressed by talking to the student, giving the student a specific example, and discussing appropriate ways to communicate.",
        "As you interact with students, situations or conversations may come about which cause you concern. Often, you will be the first person to realize students need assistance. We encourage you to utilize your relationships with students to help them find the answers or help they need.",
        "Contact students directly if you have concerns.",
        "When a student’s needs are more than you feel prepared to assist, a referral to Student Assistance is a great way to support. Together, we can work collaboratively to identify appropriate referral services and make a plan to assist the student. Student Assistance can help! If you are ever unsure of the best way to help students, the Student Assistance staff can accept referrals or consult in person, by phone call or e-mail about how you best serve each unique student to address situations or concerns. You can also refer students by submitting an Student Assistance Request, which helps us to pre-identify resources, and we will connect with you and the student quickly.",
        "Dean of Students staff are available to present information to faculty and staff groups. This information helps newer employees as well as those who are established at UIC to learn more about how the Office of the Dean of Students works with students and how we partner with faculty and staff to address a variety of student concerns and discuss referral options.",
        "We are able to customize our outreach efforts to meet the various needs of our university partners. To request a presentation, complete your request here and we’ll be in contact shortly."
