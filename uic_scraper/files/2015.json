        "Digitized reference books can provide valuable background information about your research topic. Encyclopedia articles, historical dictionaries, and other reference books summarize what scholars have already written about important historical events, groups, institutions, processes, and conflicts, giving you context for your own research. Each entry includes a bibliography referring to more detailed sources and can also provide you with vocabulary you can use when searching for books and journal articles.",
