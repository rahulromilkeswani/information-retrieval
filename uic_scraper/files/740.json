        "Ahlan Wasahlan! In the Arab region and its diasporas, people say Ahlan Wasahlan to welcome guests or visitors. The ARABAMCC extends the literal meaning of this phrase to anyone interested in creating awareness about Arab American cultures and histories, building community and solidarity, and promoting social justice and cultural diversity:  “May you arrive as part of the family and tread easily.”",
        "In response to guidelines from University Administration and in alignment with responses from many social justice organizations around the country in relation to the growing pandemic (COVID-19), The Arab American Cultural Center will be canceling all of our upcoming spring semester public programming, some will be postponed to the Fall.  We know that several of you enjoy our graduation and we want to find ways to celebrate our graduates and their accomplishments; so we will be looking at the possibility of organizing our Arab American Graduation at a later date in the summer.",
        "Even though our physical space will be closed until further notice, We Are here for you.",
        "This is a time for us to work together and support one another, share information and educate each other to keep our communities safe.",
        "Stay Calm and wash your hands",
        "In solidarity",

        "Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic Lunar Calendar. The month is 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the moon. Fasting during Ramadan is the fourth pillar of Islam. It is expected to commence on April 23 until May 23 (exact dates may vary by a day or so depending on the sighting of the moon).",
