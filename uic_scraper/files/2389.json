        "On January 31, 2020, President Trump released a Presidential Proclamation (Travel Ban 4.0) that expands on the previous travel ban by placing visa and entry restrictions on individuals traveling from the following six countries:",
        "This expanded travel ban goes into effect on Friday, February 21, 2020. Unlike the President's previous travel ban (Travel Ban 3.0), which continues in effect today, Travel Ban 4.0 suspends U.S. entry of most immigration from these countries and not nonimmigrants. As such, individuals from these six countries seeking to acquire a nonimmigrant visa and travel to the U.S., such as F-1 students, J-1 exchange visitors, and H-1B temporary workers, are not impacted by this expanded travel ban.",

Although the Supreme Court’s order did not change the travel and visa restrictions that were in place prior to June 26th, this court order cannot be appealed by any lower court. The decision permits specific visa and travel restrictions to remain in place for both immigrants and nonimmigrants from the following seven affected countries:",
