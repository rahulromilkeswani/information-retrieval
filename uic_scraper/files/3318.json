        "The strength of a UIC graduate education is demonstrated by our students’ success after graduation.",
        "In the past five years, we have graduated 600 MS students and 58 PhD students in mechanical and industrial engineering combined. Open the panels below to see a selection of the companies, agencies, and universities that represented their first destinations after UIC.",
        "What is life after UIC like for MIE graduate alumni? Find out below.",
        "PhD in Mechanical Engineering ’19",
        "",
        "Present position: Associate at Exponent",
        "What does your workday look like? I work in the vehicle engineering division as a technical specialist for vehicle design and failure analysis. I use my specialization in dynamic systems and fluid mechanics to solve issues ranging from system design to catastrophic failures. My day-to-day tasks might include the engineering analysis of dynamic systems, client relations, and on-site inspections tearing down pieces of equipment.",
        "What impact will your work have? By analyzing and understanding catastrophic failures, I hope my work will help industry design better machines such that those failures do not happen again.",
        "Why did you choose UIC? I chose UIC because of the type of research that the engineering professors are doing and the university’s commitment to diversity. I think a diverse learning environment helps you grow much faster than a homogeneous one.",
        "Favorite course: Transport Phenomena with Dr. Yarin",
        "Engineering-industry person you admire most (and why): Neil Armstrong, for the obvious reasons.",
        "Words of wisdom: Trying to balance your research tasks, coursework, and a social life is going to be overwhelming at first, but if you focus on one task at a time and relentlessly pursue it until completion, you’ll eventually get everything you wanted—and more—done. Just do one thing at a time.",
        "MS in Industrial Engineering ’16",
        "Present position: Senior Manufacturing Equipment Engineer at Tesla",
        "What’s great about your job: It’s satisfying to be a part of an organization that is pioneering the transition to sustainable energy. Tesla is a fast-paced environment, and I’m always challenged here. I also love the ability to learn and evolve as an individual and as a member of a team.",
        "How did UIC prepare you for your career? I got exposure to the latest production practices in process, operations, and ergonomics, which helped me to understand best practices in those areas.",
        "What was the most valuable student organization you joined, and why? IISE  because it helped me in gaining knowledge and a green belt certification in lean manufacturing.",
        "Favorite course: IE 463 Plant Layout and Materials Handling",
        "",
        "MS in Mechanical Engineering ’02",
        "Present position: Vice President of Hub North at Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group)",
        "What’s great about your job? The people and passion in the construction equipment business.",
        "How do you hope your work will create positive change in the world? By being part of developing sustainable solutions for our customers.",
        "How did UIC prepare you for your career? It helped me hone my skills in analytical thinking, gave me an understanding of cross functional technology, and also provided a diverse environment to help me practice interacting will all kinds of people.",
        "Would you recommend the College of Engineering to new applicants? Yes, for a multicultural experience and the close collaboration with industry."
