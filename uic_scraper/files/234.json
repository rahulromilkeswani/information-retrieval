        "The past five years has seen a resurgence of work on replicated, distributed database systems, to meet the demands of intermittently-connected clients and disaster-tolerant database systems that span data centers. Each product or prototype uses a weakened definition of replica-consistency or isolation, and in some cases new mechanisms, to obtain improvements in partition-tolerance, availability, and performance. In this talk, I?ll present a framework for defining and comparing weaker consistency and isolation properties. I?ll show how these weaker properties affect the programming model and how they are supported by new mechanisms. Although this analysis doesn?t lead to recommending one solution above all others, it does offer a framework to help architects navigate through this complex design space. This is joint work with Sudipto Das, also in MSR.",
