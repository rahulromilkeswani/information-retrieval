        "Community Standards Committee Members are empowered to hear alleged violations of the Student Disciplinary Policy , determine if a violation occurred based on the preponderance of the evidence standard, and impose sanctions as appropriate.",
        "Becoming a committee member is a great leadership opportunity which will provide you experience in critical and analytical thinking skills and conflict resolution. Becoming a committee member is easy; simply complete the application and the Office of Community Standards will provide you the training you need to serve. Service on the Community Standards Committee is open to faculty, staff, and all students who have at least a 2.0 GPA and are in good academic and student conduct standing.",
        "",
        "Sexual Misconduct Committee Members hear cases falling under the University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy. Due to the highly sensitive and challenging nature of this role, participation is only available to those faculty, staff, and students who have gone through the training and served one academic year on the Community Standards Committee, followed by a state mandated two-day session specific to these types of cases. Past participants have found the training highly informative and valuable to their roles in these processes and other places on campus. Many describe this committee as some of their most impactful work.",
        "Undergraduate students are selected to serve as members of the Faculty Senate as Student Senators through the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) Election process. The USG President (usgpresident@uic.edu) coordinates the appointment of any remaining undergraduate Senator seats after the elections. For more information about the responsibilities of Student Senators, please contact the Senate Coordinator, Elizabeth Dooley, at edooley@uic.edu."
