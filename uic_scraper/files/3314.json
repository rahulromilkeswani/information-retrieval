    "text": [
        "MS applicants: If you are applying to our MS in Mechanical Engineering program, you should have an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from an accredited college or university, and if you are applying to our MS in Industrial Engineering program, you should have an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering or a related curriculum from an accredited college or university. MS applicants should have a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a scale of 4.0, based on the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate coursework completed. Interested in master’s-level study in our department? Download our master’s program booklet here.",
        "PhD applicants: Successful applicants for doctoral study should have a master of science degree in their field from an accredited institution and should have completed substantial coursework in the chosen field of study. The department does consider outstanding PhD applicants who have only a bachelor’s degree through a program called “direct admission.” Please see the direct admission section below for more information. PhD applicants should have a GPA of 3.5 or higher on a scale of 4.0, based on the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate coursework completed.",
        "Master of Energy Engineering applicants: The MEE program has its own admissions requirements and process. We invite you to visit the Master of Energy Engineering website, which offers all the information you need.",
        "Applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate College and the requirements of the department. In general, applicants should be prepared with the following:",
        "Most PhD applicants already have earned (or are about to complete) a master of science degree in mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, or a related field. However, exceptional applicants who seek to start the PhD with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.” Students who are admitted to the PhD program with only a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, or a related field must complete all 108 credit hours toward the PhD degree (compared with students entering with an MS degree, who can transfer in 32 earned credits from their master’s program).",
        "Information about application deadlines is on the Graduate College’s admissions deadlines page.",
        "Special note: To give prospective students additional time to prepare their applications, applications from U.S. students will be accepted until June 15, 2020, for the MS and PhD in mechanical engineering or industrial engineering and for the master of energy engineering."
