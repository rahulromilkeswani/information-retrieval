        "Women are a growing force in engineering and computer science. According to the most recent data from the Society of Women Engineers, a national professional and advocacy organization, there was a 54-percent increase nationwide in the number of bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science earned by women.",
        "Still, there is work to be done. The SWE data show that only 13 percent of engineers and only 26 percent of computer scientists are female, a phenomenon that also plays out at the college level, where only about a fifth of the students earning bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science are women.",
        "UIC Engineering has developed a strong Women in Engineering Program to help create greater balance in academia and the engineering workforce. This page provides a broad summary of our programming; visit the Women in Engineering Programs website for full details.",
        "A greater role for women in engineering tomorrow means encouraging more girls to study engineering and computer science today. UIC’s encourages female applicants to participate in a SWE-sponsored campus Shadow Day to meet current students and faculty. We also run programs for K-12 students, including Girls Who Code and the Women in Engineering Summer Program.",
        "Programming for women in engineering at UIC is continually growing and changing to meet the needs of our current—and future—female students. Services currently include:"
