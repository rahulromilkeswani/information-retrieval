        "Concurrency fault are difficult to find because they usually occur under specific thread interleavings. Fault-detection tools in this area find data-access patterns among thread interleavings, but they report benign patterns as well as actual faulty patterns. Traditional fault-localization techniques have been successful in identifying faults in sequential, deterministic programs, but they cannot detect faulty data-access patterns among threads. In this talk, I will present a new automated dynamic pattern-detection-based technique that finds and ranks problematic memory access patterns for non-deadlock concurrency bugs. The technique detects significant classes of bug types, including order violations and both single-variable and multi-variable atomicity violations, which have been shown to be the most important classes of non-deadlock concurrency bugs. The technique also handles multiple bugs, identifies patterns responsible for the same bug, and provides an explanation of the bugs for developers. Finally, I will present empirical studies on both C++ and Java programs that show the effectiveness of our technique in pinpointing the interleaving patterns responsible for the bug and test cases responsible for the same bug.",
