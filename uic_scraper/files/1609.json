        "If you’re not certain what industrial engineering is or what you can do with a degree in it, don’t worry—you’re not alone. Almost all of our incoming undergraduates in IE are delving into this fascinating area for the first time. The page linked below will give you a helpful overview of this field and all its advantages.",
        "Industrial engineers find ways to make complex processes and systems work better. They help operations to run more efficiently and more safely, leading to improvements in the products we use every day, people’s jobs, and human satisfaction.",
        "As an industrial engineer, you might design and implement better ways of doing things or making things. You might find ways to improve the value or profit of goods that we use every day. You also could oversee project management, devise improvements to manufacturing plants and factories, or harness the power of data to imaging the next generation of processes.",
        "If you’ve ever looked at something and said to yourself, “I see a smarter way they could do this,” you could have the makings of a great industrial engineer.",
        "Industrial engineering majors complete coursework in four categories:",
        "As part of our accreditation process, ABET asks our department to capture the overall goals of the undergraduate programs in mechanical and industrial engineering. These are called our program educational objectives. For the industrial engineering major, they are:",
        "Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires the department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes.",
        "Students graduating from the industrial engineering program at UIC will have:",
        "In the 2019-2020 academic year, 93 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as industrial engineering majors across all class years. The department graduated 26 industrial engineering majors in the academic year ending May 2019."
