        "Margena Christian, Honors College Instructor and UIC lecturer in English, is the author of a cover story for the upcoming March issue of Ebony magazine that profiles Tyler Perry, who heads the publication’s annual Power 100 list. Christian’s article “digs into what Perry’s rise has brought him and why the fact that Hollywood still doesn’t know how to take him isn’t much of a concern to the 50-year-old director-producer-writer-playwright-actor.”  Christian teaches two Honors Courses:  HON 201 Seminar Say It Loud. I'm Black and I'm Proud: Writing About African Americans in the Media, and HON 128 Reporting While Black: Why Who Controls the Narrative Matters."
