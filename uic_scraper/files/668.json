        "The School of Literatures, Cultural Studies and Linguistics (LCSL) is home to six independent departments, three academic programs, and the Sandi Port Errant Language and Culture Learning Center. Our 40 faculty members, 200 graduate students and 700 undergraduate majors and minors proudly reflect the global orientation of the UIC campus, as well as the diverse cultural and linguistic tapestry of the city of Chicago.",
        "The School’s focus on interdisciplinarity fosters a culture of collaborative research between faculty and students and creates a vital community of scholars who share insights across disciplinary borders and cultivate connections with the broader Chicago community. Our research findings and scholarship inform curricula to help our undergraduates participate in a global society and our graduate students participate in the research and teaching community at UIC and beyond."
