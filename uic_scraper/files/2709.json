        "To convert semester hours to quarter hours multiply by 1.5; to convert quarter hours to semester hours multiply by 2/3. For example, 30 semester hours are equivalent to 45 quarter hours.",
        "The number of semester hours earned by the student determines class standing within the university.",
        "The university may use class standing to determine a student’s eligibility for receiving certain kinds of financial aid and scholarships, applying for some degree programs, enrolling in particular courses, and evaluating progress.",
        "Students may establish credit toward an undergraduate degree through the following examinations:",
        "Students must submit official grade reports/examination results to the Office of Admissions before credit can be awarded. UIC will not award transfer course credit based on another institution’s evaluation of test results.",
        "UIC will award three hours of passing credit for ENGL 160 for an ACT English subscore of 27, an SAT Evidence-Based Reading and Writing score of 630 or more (students entering UIC Spring 2019 or after), 600 or more (students entering UIC 2016 to Fall 2018), or an SAT Critical Reading score of 610 or more (prior to 2016).",
        "UIC will award credit on the basis of scores earned on the Advanced Placement Examinations administered by the College Board.",
        "Students admitted prior to Fall 2019 should consult the archived catalog from their admission year for information on credit awarded for AP exams.",
        "UIC will award credit on the basis of scores earned on the International Baccalaureate examinations as indicated below. For languages not listed below, 4 semester hours of foreign language elective credit will be awarded.",
        "Students admitted prior to Fall 2019 should consult the archived catalog from their admission year for information on credit awarded for IB exams.",
        "May satisfy requirements in the major/minor in place of FR 211, FR 212, FR 213, or FR 214.",
        "UIC awards credit based on scores earned on the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). When seeking credit for a CLEP exam taken at another institution, your official score will be evaluated on UIC's credit-granting policy.",
        "CLEP credit will not count toward general education credit, university writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, residency, major, or minor requirements. A student cannot take a CLEP exam in a subject in which they have earned credit. Three elective semester hours will be awarded per exam as detailed below. A maximum of 30 semester hours is allowed.",
        "The full list of CLEP tests available is available online. The Office of Testing Services administers CLEP tests on campus. For further information on CLEP examinations, call the UIC Testing Services at (312) 996-0919.",
        "UIC will award credit to students earning the State Seal of Biliteracy beginning in Fall 2017. Students who present appropriate documentation of the Seal to their advisor within three years of high school graduation will be awarded UIC proficiency credit as indicated below. For languages not listed below, 4 semester hours of foreign language elective credit will be awarded.",
        "Proficiency examinations may be offered in some subjects. Students should consult with the department to determine which examinations are offered. Before taking any proficiency examination, the student must obtain the consent of the college dean as well as the head or chairperson of the department concerned. Proficiency examinations in foreign languages are restricted to post-intermediate levels. No proficiency examinations are given at the introductory or intermediate levels of a foreign language.",
        "Proficiency examinations in more advanced undergraduate subjects may also be given if the head or chairperson of the department recommends and the dean of the college concerned approves it. There is no fee for these examinations.",
        "The grade given in proficiency examinations is either “pass” or “fail” but a student does not receive a “pass” unless at least the equivalent of a C is earned. Neither grade is included in the computation of the student’s average; no official record is made of a “fail.”",
        "A student who passes a proficiency examination is given the amount of credit toward graduation regularly allowed in the course if the course is acceptable in the curriculum. However, if such credit duplicates credit counted for admission to the university, it is not given.",
        "Proficiency examinations are given only to:",
        "Proficiency examinations may not be taken:",
        "Credit earned through proficiency examinations neither applies toward nor interrupts the enrollment residence requirement. See Enrollment Residence Requirement in the University Degree Requirements, Graduation, and Commencement section of the catalog.",
        "UIC utilizes a 4.00 grade point system, where 4.00 = A. See chart below:",
        "The following symbols are used in grading, but are not included in computation of the grade point average.",
        "Students may elect to take a course under the credit/no credit option according to the following provisions:",
        "Collateral courses are those courses taken outside the major department that are essential to the major and are defined as such by each college.",
        "Take the grades for each course taken and determine the grade points per hour: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.",
        "The following example illustrates how to calculate the GPA.",
        "The GPA for the example above is 38 divided by 17 or 2.23 on a 4.00 scale (2.23/4.00).",
        "Note: Courses numbered 001–099 do not carry credit toward graduation. Grades for these courses are not calculated in the GPA.",
        "Changes/corrections to final grades are permitted up to two years after recording the final grade in a student’s academic record so long as the course instructor, department chair/head, and college office approve of the change/correction. No grade changes/corrections are allowed after the two-year time limitation. Colleges are permitted, however, to adopt a more restrictive time limit policy. Students should check with their colleges concerning the time limit policy.",
        "Enrollment in more than 18 semester hours in fall or spring, or more than 12 semester hours in summer is considered overload. Overload requires permission from the student’s major college.",
        "The university uses full- and part-time enrollment in the assessment of tuition and fees. It is also used in determining eligibility for financial aid and the rules governing satisfactory academic progress for renewal of financial aid. In addition, some degree programs require or recommend full-time enrollment.",
        "The following are minimum UIC undergraduate probation and dismissal criteria that apply to both full-time and part-time students. Colleges or programs may have higher standards.",
        "A student on academic probation who earns a GPA of at least 2.00/4.00 in a given term will be removed from probation, provided the student’s cumulative GPA in all work taken at UIC is at least 2.00/4.00. Further, for the student with transfer credit, the combined average of the student’s transfer credit and UIC course work must also be at least a 2.00/4.00.",
        "A student currently on academic probation will be continued on academic probation when the one of the following occurs:",
        "The dean of the student’s college determines the conditions of probation. In addition to specifying the GPA, the dean may require the completion of specific courses, may limit the number of hours for which the student registers, and may exclude the student from taking certain courses while on probation.",
        "In other university publications Dismissal Rules are sometimes referred to as Drop Rules.",
