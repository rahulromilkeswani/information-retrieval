        "Archival and manuscript collections are the historical papers of people and organizations. As unique primary sources, they contain one-of-a-kind documents, photographs and artifacts. Special Collections and University Archives holds more than 63,000 rare books dating from 1496 and more than 14,000 linear feet of archival and manuscript material.",
        "The strengths of Special Collections and University Archives collections are the social, political and cultural history of Chicago; the history of education and practice of medicine in Chicago and elsewhere; and historical records of the University of Illinois at Chicago and its predecessors.",
        "Search Special Collections’ list of archival finding aids, or search the University Archives finding aids. Learn more about our named rare book collections.",
        "Ask a Librarian for help.",
        "Learn more about using archival finding aids.",
        "Yes! Our collections can be accessed by anyone. We particularly welcome:",
        "Absolutely! We are happy to work with UIC faculty and staff as well as non-UIC educators to structure a hands-on instruction session on a variety of topics. Please submit a request for library instruction.",
        "No. Because our collections are unique and often fragile, you must access them in the reading rooms at the Daley Library or at the Library of Health Sciences-Chicago.",
        "Occasionally museums, libraries or other heritage institutions that meet stringent insurance requirements do borrow our materials for exhibits and other purposes.",
        "For the most up-to-date information on when we are open, see hours for Richard J. Daley Library and the Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago.",
