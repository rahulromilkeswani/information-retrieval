    "title": "Assistant Professor Meenesh Singh joins the department | College of Engineering | University of Illinois at Chicago",
    "text": [
        "Dr. Meenesh R. Singh joined the Department of Chemical Engineering as an assistant professor and will be the director of the Materials and Systems Engineering Lab (MaSEL) at UIC. Prior to his appointment at UIC, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis with a joint affiliation to the University of California at Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.",
        "Singh obtained his B.E degree in chemical engineering from Sardar Patel University in 2005, M.Tech degree in chemical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2008 and PhD in chemical engineering from Purdue University in 2013. His doctoral research at Purdue University was under the guidance of Professor D. Ramkrishna, where he developed novel computational and experimental tools to study shape evolution of crystals. This work was recognized by multiple awards including the George Klinzing Best PhD Award, the AIChE process development division student paper award, the AIChE separation division graduate student research award, the Purdue outstanding graduate student research award, and the McDonnell Douglas fellowship.",
        "After his PhD, he joined UC Berkeley as a postdoctoral fellow to work with Professor Rachel A. Segalman and Professor Alexis T. Bell on artificial photosynthesis. He has designed various artificial photosynthetic systems for water-splitting and CO2 reduction to make renewable fuels. He has published over 20 articles in high impact journals including PNAS and Energy & Environmental Science, and delivered over 35 presentations in the international conferences. He is also a lead guest editor of a special issue in the International Journal of Electrochemistry and a reviewer of many leading journals.",
        "Singh is leading the Materials and Systems Engineering Lab at UIC, where his research group is developing state-of-the-art computational and experimental tools to solve grand challenges of the 21st century, including the development of carbon sequestration methods, managing nitrogen cycle, providing access to clean water, and engineering better medicines."
