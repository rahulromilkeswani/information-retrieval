        "Cold and Flu Prevention Tips",
        "It's time to start thinking about what you can do to reduce your risk of catching a cold or the flu.  As you move through your day, be aware of all the public surfaces that you touch.  Some viruses can linger on these surfaces for up to 196 hours!  So wash your hands often and don't rub your face and eyes with unclean hands.  You are too busy to be sick, so take the time to read the tips below and use them every day!",
        "Advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
        "1. Get Vaccinated",
        "The seasonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. There are several flu vaccine options this flu season.",
        "2. Avoid close contact.",
        "Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.",
        "3. Stay home when you are sick.",
        "If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. This will help prevent spreading your illness to others.",
        "4. Cover your mouth and nose.",
        "Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Flu and other serious respiratory illnesses, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), whooping cough, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are spread by cough, sneezing, or unclean hands.",
        "5. Clean your hands.",
        "Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.",
        "6. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.",
        "Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.",
        "7. Practice other good health habits.",
        "Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work, or school, especially when someone is ill. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food."
