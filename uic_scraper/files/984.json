        "UIC will be a leader in higher education through application and dissemination of knowledge gained from experience, scholarship, and innovative approaches to diversity.",
        "Unquestionably, the ultimate goal of transformative diversity is to make our campus a place where UIC’s commitment to equity, diversity, and social justice are evident: in our institutional policies and programs; in our equitable and transparent practices; in our welcoming climate where all feel they can thrive; in our engagement with the community; and most important, in the daily lives of every student, faculty, or staff member. UIC will be looked to as a model of diversity innovation and it should be prepared to share its successes and benefits with a wide audience."
