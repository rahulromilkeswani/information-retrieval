    "text": [
        "More than 60 Chicago-area CS teachers helped organize the inaugural CS Ed Camp, an event for teachers of the 440-member Chicago Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) funded by Google and sponsored in part by the UIC CS Department.",
        "The camp, a participant-driven conference created to support K-12 teachers in their computer science skills, filled up within six hours of its registration opening.",
        "“Watching the numbers grow confirmed in our minds that this event seems to be meeting a real need for teachers to be able to exchange ideas on their own terms,” said Prof. Dale Reed, a founding member of Chicago CSTA.",
        "The CSTA, which has grown to more than 25,000 professionals since it was founded in 2004 by the Association of Computing Machinery, helps empower, engage, and advocate for K-12 CS teachers worldwide.",
        "Chicago is at the forefront of the growing need for those teachers with its Computer Science for All (CS4All) initiative at Chicago Public Schools (CPS), a movement to bring computer science education to every student in the CPS system."ps://cs.uic.edu/undergraduate/women/",
