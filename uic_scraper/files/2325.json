    "text": [
        "There are other non-immigrant classifications that do not require UIC sponsorship, such as B-1, WB, and “pending Permanent Residence not based on UIC employment,” among others.",
        "Keep in mind that the information below is only a basic guide for  UIC-sponsored internationals. OIS will make all final determinations regarding the most appropriate non-immigrant classification for each  individual case.",
        "",
        "Basic Requirements: Bachelor’s degree or  higher. The person must have the degree required by the position, and  there must be a direct relationship between the person’s degree and  their work. H-1B status allows immigrant intent. Appropriate for both  non-tenure track and tenure track positions.",
        "Program limit: Up to 3 years at a time, for up to 6 years total. Extensions beyond six years may be possible under certain circumstances.",
        "Restrictions: Those individuals subject to  the Two-Year Home Residence Requirement, 212(e), as a result of previous  J-1 status do not qualify unless 1) the J-1 visitor completes the home  residence requirement or 2) obtains a recommendation from Department of  State for a waiver. A minimum salary is required, however, the minimum  acceptable salary will not be known until after the sponsorship process  has been initiated by OIS.",
        "Agencies involved: U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS)",
        "Processing times:",
        "Fees: Appropriate departmental fees will apply.",
        "",
        "Basic Requirements: May be used for short  to medium-term visitors. Funding may come from various sources: UIC,  personal funds, or outside sources, such as one’s home government. The J  program has multiple “categories;” OIS will determine the appropriate  category for each case based upon information provided on the DS-2019  Request Form. All J-1 categories must demonstrate sufficient English  proficiency. Other requirements depend upon the category:",
        "Program limit: Limits range from 6 months to 5 years depending on the J-1 category.",
        "Restrictions: J-1 status does not allow  immigrant-intent and is therefore not appropriate for tenure-track  positions. The “12-month bar” prohibits a person from becoming a  Research Scholar/Professor for 12 months if he or she was previously in J  status for more than 6 of the previous 12 months in a category other  than Short Term Scholar. The “24-month bar” prohibits a person from  becoming a Research Scholar/Professor for 24 months, if they were  previously a Research Scholar/Professor.",
        "Agencies involved: OIS is authorized by the  U.S. Department of State to issue a Form DS-2019, which the Exchange  Visitor would use to apply for a visa at a U.S. Consulate or Embassy  abroad.",
        "Processing times: Up to 10 business days. Please note, however, that applications should be submitted to OIS at  least 2-3 months prior to the intended start date.",
        "Fees:  Appropriate departmental fees will apply.",
        "",
        "Basic Requirements: Must be a Canadian or  Mexican citizen who has been admitted on a temporary basis to engage in  business on a professional level under the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA). Not appropriate for tenure-track positions.",
        "Program limit: Granted for up to one year at a time and is renewable annually for an indefinite period.",
        "Restrictions: Must have Canadian or Mexican  citizenship. Their field must fall under the list of professions in  the NAFTA agreement, and they must have the appropriate degree listed. A  list of NAFTA Professions can be found in our TN information.",
        "Agencies involved:",
        "Processing times:",
        "Fees:",
        "",
        "Basic Requirements/Restrictions: Individual must be in the top 5% of their field internationally,  and their preeminence must be documented. Often used for people who do  not qualify for H-1B status because of the two-year home residence  requirement due to prior J status. Change of status in the U.S. is not  possible if the person is subject to the Two-Year Home Residence  Requirement. For those individuals, travel and obtaining new entry visas  would be necessary for the O-1 and their dependents to obtain O status  after the USCIS approves the person for O-1 classification.",
        "Program limit: Three years initially, after which it may be extended (indefinitely) in one year increments.",
        "Agencies involved: Regional service center of USCIS",
        "Processing times: Approximately 3-6 months, unless Premium Processing is used to expedite service.",
        "Fees: Appropriate departmental fees will apply.",
