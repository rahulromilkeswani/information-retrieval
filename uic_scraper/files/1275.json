        "Only members of the Executive Council and officer approved individuals may hold keys to the WiCS Lounge, and only for the term of election. Keys should be returned to the advising department in a prompt manner following the cessation of official WiCS Lounge duties.",
        "The WiCS Office is usually open from 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM. In all other instances the doors should remain closed and locked.",
        "Assault is defined as any offensive and intentional physical contact with another person without their consent.",
        "You are free to play games in the WiCS office at any time before 10:00 AM or after 5:00 PM with the follow conditions",
        "The WiCS is a shared resource and thus, we have many people coming in any time during the day. While you are free to use the tables and chairs of the WiCS Lougne, you may not ‘hog’ a seat. You must give up your seat to another person that wants to do any of the following:",
        "The WiCS Lounge has no assigned seats and therefore, you must pick up after yourself when you leave. If you are to leave momentarily, please leave a note so nobody takes your seat. Any personal possessions that are left behind with no note will be unplugged (if applicable) and moved into a reclamation bin. Please remember, WiCS holds no liability for your possessions. If a note was left but you are gone for a period longer than 1 hour, your possessions will be moved into the reclamation bin."
