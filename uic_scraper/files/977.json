        "UIC will ensure a diverse student population, at all levels of study, will have access to admission and support for achievement and success.",
        "It is not simply a question of whom we admit as students or hire as faculty and staff (issues of access), but also how we respond to the diversity that each member of the UIC Community brings (issues of excellence) and whether those we admit or employ attain their aspirations (issues of success). In regard to students, A Mosaic for UIC Transformation views access, excellence, and success as intertwined, not as separate outcomes but as a single, complex outcome. The consequence of this fundamental idea will be the signature of UIC."
