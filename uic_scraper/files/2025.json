        "The OTM staff is experienced in screening innovations for potential commercial use. After the screen, our tech managers will sit down and provide a report of findings and work with our University innovators on a strategy for commercialization. This strategy may involve transferring knowledge and intellectual property rights to an outside entity interested in further developing the innovation, or it may involve helping a lab member create a startup venture based on University research.",
        "A disclosure is a description of your innovation – what is it? How does it work? Who will use it? Why is it better? Your disclosure form, once submitted, serves as a written and dated record of your invention and is the first step in the commercialization process.",
        "According to University General Rules Article III, Section 7, all intellectual property created by any University employee in the performance of employee duties at the University or using University facilities, equipment or funds, is owned by the University and must be disclosed. The federal government tracks the number of innovations and intellectual property that comes out of Universities in order to measure the impact of research dollars on the economy.",
        "In addition to these rules and regulations, the OTM staff is experienced at navigating the complex route a new innovation must take to become a commercial product available to society.",
        "All University members (faculty, staff, and students) may submit ideas and innovations.",
        "Submit a disclosure when you have a clear concept and before making a public disclosure, such as submitting an abstract, publication, presentation, poster, or having a discussion with a third party about the concept.",
        "Please note:",
        "Download and complete the UIC disclosure form. You will need the latest version of Acrobat Pro installed on your computer. You may download it for free from the UIC store.",
        "Follow the instructions in the Step-by-step guide and submit the form with any supporting documents to OTMSubmission@uic.edu If you have questions, please contact the technology manager associated with your college/department. We’re standing by, ready to help.",

        "Investigators should adequately plan for the possibility of the creation of intellectual property during the course of research using the guidelines below:",
