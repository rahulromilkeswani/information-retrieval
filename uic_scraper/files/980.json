Our diversity communication plan includes easy access to UIC’s diversity scholars, and calls for the active engagement of alumni, donors, and community or civic partners in highlighting UIC’s diversity accomplishments. Through the news media and diversity publications, UIC will share our diversity breakthroughs and project an image of diversity at UIC.",
