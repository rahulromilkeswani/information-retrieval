MSLC events will be held 3–4 times throughout the academic year and will focus on a variety of issues facing multicultural scholars including balancing research, departmental service, mentoring students, dedicating time for writing, among others. The MSLC is a supportive space designed to empower scholars with diverse identities to thrive in their roles at UIC."
