        "Our Service Leaders take a holistic approach to service learning. Through intentional curriculum and engaging experiences, our Service Leaders gain the ability of being a more conscious, responsible volunteer, while putting theory into action. Service Leaders take on responsibilities for the MLK Day of Service, UIC Day of Service, and other volunteer opportunities (Make Mondays Matter, GIVE, Ignite the Conversation, Party at the Polls). Service Leaders attend bi-weekly meetings with their cohort, and receive training and support on how to build and sustain relationships with the greater community.",

        "“The current political climate created a need for students to be informed and actively engaged in civic and political matters. This program has allowed me to provide the resources to young adults that allow them to be the change they want to see.”"
