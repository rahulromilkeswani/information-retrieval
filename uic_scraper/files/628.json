        "Student Affairs Giving Opportunities",
        "Student Affairs offers programs‚ practical experience and training opportunities that allow students to develop beyond the classroom. As state support for higher education continues to decrease‚ co-curricular programs are hit especially hard. Contributions can benefit Student Affairs’ Annual Fund‚ Student Leader Scholarships‚ Leadership Programs and Diversity Initiatives.",
        "Student Affairs provides quality services to create an environment that is welcoming and supportive to students and parents. Gifts to Student Affairs Annual Fund support work immediately in the areas and programs that are key to student success and the vitality of the campus. Please note that gifts of $1000 or more entitle you to membership in our Friends of the Vice Chancellor club.",
        "Student Affairs offers a variety of leadership training programs and initiatives. The fundamental philosophy of the Student Leadership Programs is that every student has the potential to become a leader and that leadership is a continual process. Within this framework‚ the Leadership Development Programs encourage a lifelong commitment to service and community. Please note that gifts of $1000 or more entitle you to membership in our Friends of the Vice Chancellor club.",
        "As one of the most diverse campuses in the country‚ UIC students and graduates benefit from being a part of a diverse student body. Student Affairs seeks to further enhance diversity programming and establish a diversity training resource center for the campus. Please note that gifts of $1000 or more entitle you to membership in our Friends of the Vice Chancellor club.",
        "Established in 2001‚ SEE scholarships offer financial support to UIC undergraduates who demonstrate leadership skills through involvement in campus co-curricular activities. The scholarship recognizes the role of co-curricular life in the vitality of the campus. The SEE is the first endowed scholarship program at UIC specifically designed to recognize student leaders. Please note that gifts of $1000 or more entitle you to membership in our Friends of the Vice Chancellor club.",
        "A gift to the UIC Gymnastics Club enables young people to compete as student-athletes while embracing the unique academic and diverse cultural opportunities in Chicago. Your generosity also helps UIC fulfill its mission of providing student-athletes access to world-class resources and modern facilities."
