    "text": [
        "To our students, faculty, and staff:",
        "We at the Counseling Center hope this message finds you healthy and safe. Though we are not physically present in our offices at this time, we want you to know that we remain dedicated to supporting students’ mental health and well-being, more now than ever. We have worked hard to create remote access to our services and remain available to both new and existing clients. We are using Webex and phone formats for initial consultations and individual counseling sessions and are working to bring some of our groups and workshops to online formats as well.",
        "In addition to this modification of our existing services, we are reaching out to the university community during these challenging times through other new and accessible ways. One of these efforts is represented by this newsletter, within which we eagerly share information, support and resources, in addition to updates found on our website. We are hopeful that the materials shared here will help generate ideas for sustaining well-being and also facilitate feelings of connectedness on and off campus.",
        "Though the future remains uncertain, we continue to offer you the support of the Counseling Center, if even from afar.",
        "Sincerely,",
        "Joseph Hermes, Ph.D."
