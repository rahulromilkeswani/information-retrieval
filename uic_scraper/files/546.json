    "text": [
        "“Chicago New Media 1973–1992” is a public exhibition, to be held November 1 – December 15, 2018, that illuminates the largely untold story of Chicago’s computer-based art and design legacy, and provides new historical understanding of the artists and organizations that contributed to digital art and technology in the latter half of the 20th Century. The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is prominently featured. The exhibition spans the dates EVL was founded (1973) as a joint effort of the UIC Computer Science (CS) department and the School of Art and Design, through EVL’s introduction of the CAVE™ automatic virtual environment (1992).",
        "The “Chicago New Media 1973–1992” exhibition is part of Terra Foundation’s major citywide celebration of the unique and vital role Chicago plays as America’s crossroads of creativity and commerce. It is curated by VGA Gallery, an art organization devoted to video games and new media, and will be held at Gallery 400, 400 South Peoria St., Chicago, IL 60607."
