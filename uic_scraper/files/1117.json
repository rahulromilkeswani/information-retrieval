        "The College of Nursing is recognized as one of the top colleges of nursing in the country and is internationally renowned for its nursing leadership. Exciting and challenging opportunities are available for capable, dedicated, and caring individuals who will be future leaders in healthcare. The University of Illinois School of Nursing was founded in 1951 and became the College of Nursing in 1959. The College of Nursing is located in close proximity to the Colleges of Applied Health Sciences, Dentistry, Medicine, Pharmacy, and the School of Public Health. The libraries and scientific and clinical resources make up one of the largest medical centers in the world.",
        "The College of Nursing offers programs of study leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing; the Master of Science, the Doctor of Philosophy and the Doctor of Nursing Practice with entry at the post-baccalaureate or post-master’s level. In addition, the college offers a pre-licensure program of graduate study leading to a Master of Science degree in nursing. The Graduate Entry Master of Science program is specifically designed for students who hold baccalaureate degrees in other fields and want to pursue a master’s degree in nursing. In addition to the Chicago campus, the college has five regional sites within the state: Peoria, Quad Cities, Rockford, Springfield, and Urbana. The traditional Bachelor of Science in Nursing program is offered at the Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana sites. The graduate entry master’s program is offered at the Chicago and Urbana sites. The PhD program is offered only at the Chicago site. The Master of Science and Doctor of Nursing Practice are offered at all sites. The RN to BSN program is offered online through UIC Extended Campus.",
        "The College of Nursing undergraduate program leads to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The curriculum is divided into three levels: foundation, middle, and terminal. The foundation level, freshman and sophomore years, includes those lower-division non-nursing courses that represent the basic learning necessary for the completion of the course of study. The middle level, junior year, includes most upper-division courses that prepare the graduate as a nurse generalist. The terminal level, senior year, represents those upper-division, senior-level courses at the end of the nursing program that synthesize previous learning.",
        "The Bachelor of Science in Nursing provides students with the basic nursing preparation and eligibility to apply for the National Council Licensure Exam for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). For students who are already licensed registered nurses and wish to further their education, the college offers an RN to BSN completion program (offered through UIC Extended Campus).",
        "College of Nursing programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and approved by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR). The college holds membership in the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN).",
        "Applications to the BSN program are accepted for fall admission only. Students are admitted to the college in one of four ways:",

Applicants can view information about course equivalencies and how courses transfer to UIC and the College of Nursing through Transferology. See the Office of Admission Transfer Guide for more information about transfer admission requirements.",
        "In addition, all students will be required to have a background check and drug test upon admission. If the results of either requirement indicate that a student would not be eligible for placement at the college’s practicum agencies, the student’s admission will be rescinded.",
        "Students applying to the RN to BSN program must meet the following minimum requirements:",
        "Students who have graduated from a state-approved associate’s degree in nursing (ADN) program and who hold a current license as registered professional nurse will receive 33 semester hours of proficiency credit. The credit will be awarded upon successful completion of 8 nursing semester hours in the RN to BSN program.",
        "Students applying to the DA ADN + BSN program must meet the following minimum requirements:",
        "Students enrolled in the DA ADN + BSN program must meet the following minimum requirements in order to graduate:",
        "Upon graduation from the contracted associate degree program, dual admission in both institutions ends and the students remains a UIC College of Nursing student only. However, the student must take the NCLEX-RN licensure examination as a graduate of the community college ADN degree program and present proof of exam passage and RN license to UIC College of Nursing by the end of the first semester of BSN-level-only courses. Failure to pass the NCLEX-RN examination and/or present a current U.S. RN license will result in the student not being able to progress beyond the first semester of the BSN completion program until passing scores and U.S. RN licensure are provided.",
        "Students who have graduated from a state-approved associate degree in nursing (ADN) program contracted with UIC for DA ADN + BSN and who hold a current license as a registered professional nurse will receive 33 semester hours of proficiency credit. The credit will be awarded upon successful completion of 8 semester hours of the UIC BSN completion degree.",
        "The College of Nursing does not admit first year students to the BSN program because two years of college level prerequisite courses are required. Although those seeking admission to UIC as first year students may apply to any college at the university, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences provides an advising track for students interested in health professions.  Students can list Pre-Nursing as their educational goal. Those seeking admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as first year students should apply to either the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences or the College of Applied Health Sciences, both of which provide an advising track for students interested in several health professions. More information on admission to UIUC can be found online. Those seeking admission to the  University of Illinois at Springfield as first year students should apply through the UIS website.",

For more information, please see the Guaranteed Professional Program Admissions information in the Admissions section of this catalog.",
        "To earn the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from UIC, students need to complete the degree requirements of the university and college that are in effect at the time of initial registration. It is essential for each student to become familiar with the degree requirements stated in this catalog and to keep up-to-date with published changes. If requirements change, continuing students and those whose attendance at UIC has been interrupted for no more than two years may elect to complete the new graduation requirements or may continue to fulfill those requirements in effect at the time of initial registration. Students who return to UIC after an absence of more than two years are responsible for meeting the requirements of the university and college in effect at the time of reenrollment. If courses originally required are no longer offered, the college has the prerogative of specifying substitutes.",
        "Note: The college retains the right to change educational policy and graduation requirements at any time. This may affect currently enrolled students’ standing.",
        "The College of Nursing semester hour requirement for graduation is 120 semester hours.

        "Students declare their intent to graduate online using my.UIC.edu. The deadline for submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will be made following the close of the term. If a student has satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student’s name will be placed on the official degree list.",
        "At a minimum, the last 30 semester hours of university work must be taken at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Concurrent attendance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and another collegiate institution or enrollment during the summer at another institution, when approved by the student’s college, does not interrupt the UIC enrollment residence requirement for graduation.",
        "To be considered full-time, a student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 semester hours fall and spring terms. During the regular academic year, an academic course load exceeding 18 semester hours must be approved in the College Office of Academic Programs.",
        "A cumulative grade point average is calculated. When the nursing or cumulative grade point average is below 2.00/4.00, the student is placed on probation.",
        "A student not currently on academic probation will be placed on academic probation at the end of any term in which the student earns less than a 2.00/4.00 in nursing, non-nursing, or cumulative grade point average.",
        "A student currently on academic probation will be continued on academic probation when:",
        "The Undergraduate Admissions and Academic Standards Committee determines the conditions of probation. In addition to specifying the grade point average, the committee may require the completion of specific courses, may limit the number or hours for which the student registers, and may exclude the student from taking certain courses while on probation.",
        "Undergraduate students may drop courses using my.UIC.edu through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop courses with the permission of their major college. If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program.",

If the student is unable to attend discussion group due to an accident, illness, or injury, the student must contact the course coordinator to make up any work that is missed.",
        "Attendance at all laboratory sessions is expected. In the event that a student misses a laboratory session due to illness or personal emergency, the student will make arrangements to complete the session and the assigned exercise. Failure to do so will result in the student’s grade being lowered, and the student may not be able to progress to the next lab session until the make-up is completed.",
        "Practicum attendance is required. Students must be prepared for the practicum experience. If a faculty member determines that the student is not prepared to participate fully in the practicum experience, the faculty member may ask the student to leave or not to participate in certain activities. The student’s performance for the day will be considered unsatisfactory and will influence the practicum evaluation. If written assignments are required, a grade of zero will be given. In the event of illness or a personal emergency, students must notify the practicum instructor per the instructions in the course syllabus. Students who miss more than 15% of a course’s total practicum hours, regardless of their level of performance otherwise, may be required to repeat that course before progressing in the program.",

        "A nonclinical nursing course in which a grade below C is received must be repeated the first term the course is offered again.",
        "The original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. The original grade and the grade for each repeat will be calculated into the grade point average.

Students without a car will need to find alternative methods of transportation.",
        "Prior to admission to the College of Nursing, prospective students should contact the UIC Office of Admissions regarding advice on acceptance of transfer credit. Following admission, students are assigned an advisor within the College of Nursing who will assist them with course and career planning. Mandatory advising is required each term.",
