        "You probably already know which program you intend to apply for, but we encourage you to take some time to look through the program’s website. Look into the college's achievements, their research, and any other resources they provide prospective students. Note the key contacts, such as the program coordinator, and contact information for your intended program.",
        "Familiarize yourself with the Admissions requirements (application fee or waiver, academic credentials, English proficiency requirements).",
        "And refer to the program’s website for Program-specific requirements (which may include items such as the GRE test, Personal Statements, Letters of Recommendation, etc.).",
        "Our ETS Institutional Code for TOEFL and GRE is 1851.",
        "See what funding options are available to you. The Graduate College has compiled a wide range of great information about funding opportunities and financial resources on their website. Your intended program's website may also provide a list of funding opportunities specific to the program. Here are a few:",
        "The Apply page will direct you to the program's website when there's a special application process in place for the program outside of the general graduate process.",
        "Applications with a fee due will remain in an incomplete status. If an application fee waiver was selected, Admissions will verify that the waiver applies.",
        "You can check your status online. This is where you’ll find your checklist noting items that have been received and those that are still being requested.",
        "Additional items may be added to your checklist if received items are incorrect or additional documentation is needed. Note that applications will switch from a complete to incomplete status if submitted documents are found to be insufficient and additional items are added.",
        "After all Admissions requirements are satisfied, application records are referred to the program for their review, though programs may have already begun their review by that time. Admissions and program staff are able to access application materials after they are submitted. They are typically reviewed in the order they are received.",
        "The time that it takes for an application to go through the review process varies by program. After the program has completed their review of an application, they communicate the admission recommendations and denials to Admissions and we update the official record after a final quick review. Some programs communicate their decisions to Admissions continually throughout the cycle while others do so in bursts. Ultimately, it depends on the timeline and approach each program takes for their review.",
        "In certain cases where minimum requirements are not met or additional approval is needed, applications recommended for admission by Graduate College programs may need to undergo an additional review by the Graduate College. The Graduate College may decide to uphold the program's admission recommendation or, in certain cases, deny the application.",
        "This would not apply to professional level programs and graduate level programs that do not fall under the Graduate College.",
        "Once a final decision is entered by the Office of Admissions, the application portal will be updated to note the decision and an official decision letter will be mailed out.",
        "Congratulations! Access our Admitted Student page to follow up with next steps, including submission of official credentials, if needed.",
        "International students who will need a student visa should submit OIS-requested documents for the Office of International Services.",
        "Admission can be deferred once for up to one academic year (e.g., Fall admission can be deferred to the following Spring, Summer, or Fall terms).",
        "Start by notifying the program that you’d like to defer admission. They must first approve deferrals. Program-approved deferrals are then forwarded to us for final approval and official updates to the student record.",
        "Our office unfortunately does not often know the exact reasons why a program may have denied an applicant.",
        "You may contact the program directly to inquire about the decision they made. In some cases, programs may be able to advise you on what you can do to improve your applicant profile or successfully apply for a future term.",
