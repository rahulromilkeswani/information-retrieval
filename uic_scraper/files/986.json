    "text": [
        "UIC will offer living and lifelong learning environments that promote understanding and appreciation of identities.",
        "The Office of Diversity’s Inclusive Classroom Initiative (ICI) lives at the intersection of three key institutional priorities at UIC: diversity, equity, and inclusion; student success; and teaching excellence. The initiative is based on the understanding that effective, high-quality teachers understand both the academic discipline—what they are teaching—as well as the students that they teach—who they are teaching. They also, importantly, take pedagogy seriously—how they are teaching. In its broadest sense, the Inclusive Classroom Initiative is designed to support UIC faculty in intentionally constructing classroom environments which encourage the learning and overall well-being of all students at UIC.",
        "The ICI consists of a series of modules developed by faculty content experts on topics that are relevant and specific to UIC. Each module focuses on building empathy, creating relevance and providing practical strategies faculty can use in their classrooms regardless of disciplines.",
        "A theorist, methodologist, and empirical researcher, Dr. Kate Caldwell has a background in Disability Studies and interdisciplinary social sciences. She brings this expertise and her personal experience with disability to approaching complex issues where various fields intersect; facilitating dialogue across disciplines.",
        "Dr. Kee Chan is a passionate teacher of the science and management of health and wellness. Her teaching interest includes the intersection of science and strategic planning, financial analysis, public health management, and medical decision-making analysis. Dr. Chan researches the comparative analysis of new biomedical intervention and testing on improving population health and its impact on healthcare services delivery. Dr. Chan is an expert on developing mathematical models to determine time-saving and cost-effective strategies in improving public health. She participated in the Institute of Emerging Leadership for Online Learning organized by the Online Learning Consortium (OLC) and she is also certified as an instructional designer by the OLC.  Dr. Chan is an author of an upcoming textbook titled Advanced Management and Leadership in Population Health (publisher Jones and Bartlett Learning).",
        "Dr. Leah Goodman developed and teaches “Promoting Wellbeing”, a credit-bearing course which aims to support student wellness and academic success. She also teaches “Human Sexuality and Health Science”, and mentors undergraduate and graduate students. Her work at UIC focuses on the development of mental health and wellbeing supports. Leah serves as faculty advisor for the Mental Health and Disability Alliance, sits on the Chancellor’s Committee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities, and is an Honors College Fellow. She is interested in exploring the ways we define and provide student support, and seeks to develop initiatives that promote wellbeing, inclusion, health, equity, and student success.",
        "Dr. Kim Potowski is Professor in the Department of Hispanic & Italian Studies, with courtesy appointments in Latin American and Latino Studies and in Curriculum and Instruction. She directs UIC’s Heritage Spanish program and is the founding director of its summer study abroad program in Oaxaca, Mexico. Her research focuses on connections between language and identity. She has authored and edited over 12 books as well as several Spanish textbooks. Her advocacy for the value of dual language education in promoting bilingualism and academic achievement was the focus of her 2013 TEDx talk “No child left monolingual.”",
        "Dr. Shanon Reckinger has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of Colorado Boulder with a research focus in numerical methods, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean modeling.  Post-PhD, she received an MS degree in Computer Science Education at Stanford University and participated in the Faculty-In-Residence program at Google.  At UIC, she teaches in the Computer Science department and continues her research in CS Education, particularly in the area of inclusive pedagogy design, strategies for improving problem solving skills, and interventions to increase retention."
