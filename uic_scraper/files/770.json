        "Honors College students who have completed their freshman year can participate formally in faculty research as a way of satisfying the honors activity requirement. UIC has a wealth of outstanding researchers, and the Undergraduate Research Assistant Program gives honors students an opportunity to work with some of them. The range of research activity is wide, including business, education, engineering, the humanities and the arts, the natural sciences and mathematics, and the social sciences.",
        "Undergraduate Research Assistants are expected to put in approximately six hours a week on a project that is part of, or relevant to, the faculty member’s research. The faculty will explain how the work done by the student fits into the larger project, and will make sure that the activity, whatever it is, has educational benefit for the students.",
        "Students who participate in the URA program should register for HON 225 when their URA application is submitted, and after arrangements have been made with a supervising faculty member. A directory of faculty/researchers, listing their research interests, is available through the Undergraduate Research Experience Website.",
