        "My main goal is to develop new planning and design practices for more intelligent, integrated and distributed urban infrastructure systems. Whether it is the water/wastewater system, the electricity grid, the building stock, or the transportation system, all are part of a nexus of co-dependent and ubiquitous elements of infrastructure that is vital to our cities. This network aspect of urban infrastructure is paramount and may hold the key for a more sustainable and resilient future.",
