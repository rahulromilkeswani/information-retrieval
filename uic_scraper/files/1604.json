        "A computer engineering major from UIC positions you to develop computer technologies—hardware and software—that increase human capabilities worldwide.",
        "Think of all the things that have changed in computing in the last two decades. Global society is in constant pursuit of computers that are smaller, more powerful, and easier to use. Computer engineering helps to determine not only the nature of the machines we use, but also the type of software they can handle and what that means for people on a day-to-day basis.",
        "Computer engineering is a fast-changing field, and UIC’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering provides you with an education that will help you drive and lead those changes—not just keep pace with them.",
        "The computer engineering major is outlined in full detail in UIC’s undergraduate course catalog. The information below offers an overview of what CE majors can expect.",
        "Computer engineering majors complete coursework in three categories:",
        "The ECE department has identified groups of courses that can help guide your academic planning based on the areas of electrical and computer engineering in which you seek to specialize. You can find descriptions of each track and its associated courses on this page.",
        "As part of our accreditation process, ABET asks our department to capture the overall goals of the electrical and computer engineering programs. These are called our educational program objectives. Within a few years of graduation, our talented graduates will:",
        "Another part of the ABET accreditation process requires the department to identify the specific knowledge and skills that students are intended to have when they complete their undergraduate education. These are called student outcomes.",
        "Students graduating from the electrical engineering, computer engineering, and engineering physics programs at UIC will have:",
        "In the 2019-2020 academic year, 325 students were enrolled at UIC Engineering as computer engineering majors across all class years. The department graduated 36 computer engineering majors in the academic year ending May 2019."
