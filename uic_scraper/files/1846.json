        "Students applying directly to the two-year program are expected to demonstrate a record of professional experience in design and to present a considerable and significant portfolio of work. Students applying through the MDes Preliminary Year are typically seeking a career shift from relevant expereince in a non-design field. MDes Preliminary Year applicants are required to submit a standard two-year application designating a field of interest (Industrial or Graphic Design).
