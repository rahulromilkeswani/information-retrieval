    "text": [
        "We have a very strict registration policy for all CS graduate students.  Graduate students may not register for more than 3 CS didactic classes (i.e., CS 400-494 and CS 500-594 classes) – 12 credit hours (9 if registering for CS 491-Seminar).",
        "Check your registration to ensure you meet the restrictions on registration of CS classes.",
        "In that current semester, they can be removed from courses by the Department until their credit hours of didactic classes no longer exceeds the limit defined above. In the following semester an advising hold can be placed preventing registration, hold removed only after meeting with the DGS",
        "",
        "We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs."
