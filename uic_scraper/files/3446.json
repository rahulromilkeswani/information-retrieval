        "You can check your application status online at any time. This will show you a checklist of all your items and let you know if they’re correct and complete.",
        "Personal interviews are by invitation only.",
        "The time that it takes for an application to go through the review process varies. All elements submitted as part of your application are reviewed to gain a picture of you as a potential student, so the sooner you get all elements in, the sooner your application can be reviewed. After we complete our review of your application, we communicate recommendations and denials to Admissions.",
        "All admissions decisions recommended by the department must be approved and finalized by Admission and the Graduate College. The Graduate College may decide to uphold our recommendation or deny the application.",
        "Once Admissions enters a decision, your application status updates online and a letter is mailed to you.The official letter of acceptance comes from the Office of Admissions, not from our department",
        "Visit your online application status page frequently for updates.",
        "Congratulations! Access our Admitted Student page for your next steps.",
        "International students: If you’ll need a student visa, you should submit OIS financial documents through the application checklist for the Office of International Services. Contact the OIS concerning document requests and visa processing.",
        "Admission can be deferred once for up to one academic year (for example, Fall admission can be deferred to the following Fall term). Notify us as soon as possible that you’d like to defer admission. If your deferral is approved, we’ll forward it to campus for final approval and official updates to the student record.",
        "You may contact us directly to inquire about our decision. In some cases, we can advise you on what you can do to improve your applicant profile or successfully apply for a future term.",
        "We’re here to help. Get in touch with Harry Rhodes, program director, with any post-application questions.",
