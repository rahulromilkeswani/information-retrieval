        "We will discuss what makes technology work (or not work!) in the \"real world\". Each week we will start with a presentation about some new user interface and a discussion of positives and negatives. We will follow with limited project work based on attendee interest. No experience in HCI or any programming/crazy cool interaction technology neccesary. Suggestions and new ideas from experts are also welcome!",

        "9/29/2015:",
        "Designed a simple \"kilometer converter\" UI and started to evaluate it together on the whiteboard. Comparison to my simple \"IPhone app\"-like interface and discussed how (with a current acm account) to make something similar using javascript and very simple HTML. Update on semester project plan. next time: robots, more discussion of project plans (and maybe more examples of \"design by picture\")",
        "possible new topic for future meetings: colors and colorschemes, suggestions on some to use, where and how - based on recent and future interest/questions within the group.",
        "10/13/2015",
        "Investigated the interfaces and interaction of Zoomer and I-Cybie. We looked at the user manuals for both dogs and compared their temperments, charging styles and overall design. Early voting suggests that \"Zoomer\" (painted to look like a Dalmation puppy) appears to be the \"most authentic\" dog, but the I-Cybie also gets a lot of applause and praise when he starts showing off his abilities as well! Upcoming: planning possible projects involving the robot dogs and previous projects and work we have done as a group.",
