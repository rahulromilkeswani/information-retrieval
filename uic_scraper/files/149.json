        "Annual gifts to the UIC Engineering Excellence Fund are a powerful form of support because the donations are unrestricted and allow the College to enhance the educational experience of engineering students.

        "UIC Engineering is strengthened by the generosity of our dedicated alumni and friends. As you reflect on your own philanthropic goals, we hope you will also consider a planned gift to the University of Illinois Foundation to benefit the College of Engineering through your will, living trust, or retirement plan. There are also ways to structure a gift to provide a lifetime income stream to yourself and/or a loved one while receiving an immediate income tax deduction. We’re happy to share customized illustrations for these types of arrangements at no cost or obligation.",
