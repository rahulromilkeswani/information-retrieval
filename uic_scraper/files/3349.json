        "MS applicants: Successful master’s program applicants should have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university in electrical engineering, computer engineering, or a related field. MS applicants should have a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a scale of 4.0, based on the last 60 hours of undergraduate coursework completed. Download our MS degree booklet for an overview of our master’s program.",
        "PhD applicants: Successful applicants for doctoral study should have a master of science degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, or a related field and should have completed substantial coursework in the chosen field of study. The department does consider outstanding PhD applicants who have only a bachelor’s degree through a program called “direct admission.” Please see the direct admission section below for more information. PhD applicants should have a GPA of 3.5 or higher on a scale of 4.0, based on the last 60 hours of undergraduate coursework completed.",
        "Note: In making all admissions decisions, the department does consider the institution where you earned your prior degrees: for example, the requirements above may be relaxed slightly if you studied at a top-ranked school in your country.",
        "There are two phases to the admissions process for graduate study in electrical and computer engineering.",
        "Step 1: Graduate College review. Prospective graduate students must apply for admission through the UIC Graduate College. Within two to three days of completing your online Graduate College application, you will receive an email acknowledging receipt and indicating that you can log back into the system to begin uploading supplementary application materials (see Step 2 below).",
        "Step 2: Departmental review.The department is very interested in reviewing the additional documents you will upload as part of the application process. These include your statement of purpose, résumé, GRE general test scores, specialization form (for PhD applicants only), and other documents you might want to submit for consideration. These documents will help to distinguish you from other applicants. The next section explains them in detail.",
        "Applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate College and the requirements of the electrical and computer engineering department. In general, applicants should be prepared with the following:",
        "",
        "Most PhD applicants already have earned (or are about to complete) a master of science degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, or a related field. However, exceptional applicants who seek to start the PhD with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.” Students who are admitted to the PhD program with only a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, or a related field must complete all 108 credit hours toward the PhD degree (compared with students entering with an MS degree, who can transfer in 32 earned credits from their master’s program).",
        "",
        "For students seeking to begin study in the fall semester:",
        "For students seeking to begin study in the spring semester:",
        "All current application deadlines are available on the Graduate College’s admissions deadlines page."
