    "text": [
        "The mental health staff at the Counseling Center support our undocumented students and join you in challenging barriers to your well-being and acceptance. We understand that these barriers place additional strain that may negatively impact motivation, self-esteem, mood, academic performance, relationships, and family stability. We are here to help you strengthen personal resolve and bolster resilience and courage to address these challenges and the stress related to deportation fears, xenophobia/racism, and identity concerns.",
        "The Counseling Center is committed to fully maintain the confidentiality and privacy of undocumented students and we continue to welcome and support students regardless of their immigration status. We provide a safe, confidential space for undocumented students to meet with qualified mental health professionals. Please know that you are welcome here.",
