        "Student Disciplinary Policy",
        "The purpose of the Student Conduct process is to assist each student in the development of a responsible lifestyle which is rewarding to the individual student, respectful of the rights of others, and compatible with the legal norms of society. The Student Conduct process plays a supportive role in the development of responsible student behavior. If the behavior of a student conflicts with established university standards, the Student Conduct process seeks to educate the student about the personal and social consequences of his or her behavior."
