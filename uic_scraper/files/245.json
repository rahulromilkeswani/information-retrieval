    "text": [
        "I will present the BitBlaze project, describing how we build a unified binary program analysis platform and use it to provide novel solutions to computer security problems, including automatic vulnerability discovery and defense, in?depth malware analysis, and automatic extraction of security models for analysis and verification. The BitBlazeBinary Analysis Infrastructure is a fusion of static and dynamic analysis techniques and enables a set of powerful, novel symbolic reasoning techniques on program binaries. I will give an overview of the WebBlaze project, aiming at designing and developing new techniques and tools to improve web security, including automatic dynamic symbolic execution on JavaScript for in?depth vulnerability detection in rich web applications. Finally, I will describe some ongoing efforts in DroidBlaze, an automatic security analysis infrastructure for Android apps.",
        "More information about BitBlaze and WebBlaze is available at http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu and http://webblaze.cs.berkeley.edu",
