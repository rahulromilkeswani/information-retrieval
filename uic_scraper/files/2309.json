    "text": [
        "If your immigration status ends, so does  your work permission. J-2 status is dependent on that of the J-1. If  the J-1 is eligible for an extension of status, he/she should seek the  consultation of his/her international adviser/Responsible Officer. A  pending application at USCIS for a new EAD does not authorize you to  continue working (check with your employer for additional information). When you receive your new EAD, you should update the Work Eligibility  Form (Form I-9) with your employer.",
        "USCIS requires a letter from you, the J-2  dependent, requesting work permission. The purpose of the letter is to  explain to USCIS that the primary J-1 Exchange Visitor has sufficient  resources for his or her own expenses, and will not depend on your  earnings. In the letter you should indicate the sources and amount of  the J-1 Exchange Visitor’s support. You should give a reason for  wanting to work, some worthwhile interest or activity that might include  family travel or recreational or cultural activities. In your letter you should explicitly state that income from your earnings will not be used to support the J-1 Exchange Visitor.",
        "I would like to apply for J-2 work permission.",
        "My [husband’s or wife’s] Form DS-2019 shows $20,000                 in support, including $15,000 from [name] University, and $5,000                 in personal funds.",
        "I understand that none of my earnings may be used for the support                of my J-1 spouse.",
        "Sincerely,",
        "[Your signature]",
        "[Your name]",
        "",
        "Taxes: The earnings of J-2 dependents are subject to  applicable federal, state and local taxes, as well as Social Security  deductions. Employers are required by law to withhold those taxes from  paychecks. You must file an income tax return, Form 1040NR, by April 15th  each year, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxes due the  prior calendar year. The Return determines whether you owe additional  taxes or if you will receive a refund. You must also file a “Required  Statement” with Form 1040NR; see IRS Publication 519, “U.S. Tax Guide  for Aliens.” You may also want to review information on the “International Taxpayer” section of the IRS website.",
        "Study: J-2 dependents are eligible for  degree-seeking study in the U.S. as long as the    primary J-1 visa  holder is maintaining his/her status. J-2s will not be eligible for on-campus employment unless they possess an EAD card.",
        "Extension of J-2 status: J-2 dependents are covered by the extension of stay granted to the J-1 visa    holder.",
        "U.S. Social Security Number: J-2 dependents may apply for an U.S. Social Security Number only with a valid    EAD Card, DS-2019, and passport.",
        "Driver Licenses: Please see the “Drivers License” section under “Life In Chicago” on our website for further information."
