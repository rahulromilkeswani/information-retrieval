        "Children in the U.S. are required to attend school from age 6 to 16. There are public   and private schools in every neighborhood. The school year begins in   late August and ends in May or June. You will want to find out before   the school year starts what you will need to do to register and enroll   your child in school. Many schools have kindergarten for children who   are 5 years old. For children 3-6 years of age, the Children’s Center is available at the University for a fee. Because space is limited, you are encouraged to apply in advance.",
        "",
        "Chicago is characterized by four distinct  seasons. The flat terrain  of the Midwest combined with Lake Michigan  make Chicago’s weather  unpredictable and frequently extreme. Summer is  very warm and often  humid. The hottest temperatures occur throughout  July and August and  can reach a high of 95 – 100 degrees Fahrenheit (35 –  37 Centigrade). The coldest days are usually in January and February  when the  temperature can drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees   Centigrade). Snow and strong winds characterize a Chicago winter. Fall   and Spring weather can be rainy and changeable but typically include   many sunny and moderate days. You will need appropriate clothes for   these distinct seasons (i.e. coats, boots, hats, gloves, etc.).",
        "Chicago Winter Survival Guide: read below for winter tips and fun suggestions.",
        "Clothing:",
        "Typical winter clothes include: a heavy winter jacket/coat,   gloves/mittens, a scarf, a hat or earmuffs, thick socks (typically   wool), long underwear, and snow boots. Temperature varies in Chicago on a   day by day basis. The best advice is to check weather conditions and  be  prepared.",
        "Public Transportation:",
        "Public transportation can be slower in the winter months due to snow,   ice, or sleet. Be aware of this if you are taking public transportation   so you can plan accordingly. You can check the Chicago Transit   Authority (CTA) bus schedule anytime of the year on the CTA’s website: http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/home.jsp.",
        "Driving:",
        "Driving can be challenging during the winter months. Always keep an ice   scraper and brush in your car during the winter months. Jumper cables   are another essential item (at any time of the year) to have with you at   all times in your car.",
        "Biking:",
        "If you plan on biking during the winter months, we recommend checking   weather conditions before doing so. It can be very challenging to bike   during the winter months in Chicago because of the very cold   temperatures, as well as ice and snow on the ground. Be careful.",
        "Ice:",
        "Be careful of ice! There is something called black ice which is not   actually black, but transparent. It is very difficult to see because it   takes on the color of the surface beneath it. The most common places to   find black ice are asphalt and concrete.",

Both stores have a preferred card plan for regular   customers, providing them with discounts on certain items. Treasure   Island Foods, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and Wild Oats offer more organic   products.",
        "",
        "You should be able to meet all of your dietary needs in Chicago’s   diverse city. You do not need to bring special food items from your   home country. Chicago is a city of ethnic neighborhoods and you can find   grocery stores for African, Chinese, Caribbean, European, Greek, Indian, Italian, Korean, Latin American, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Russian, Thai, and Vietnamese products. You can find grocery stores near you, by entering your zip code and city.",
