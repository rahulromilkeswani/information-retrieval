        "Business Intelligence (BI) refers to technologies for collecting, integrating, analyzing, and presenting large volumes of information to enable better decision making. Traditionally, BI systems have been designed to support off-line, strategic decision making. As enterprises become more automated, real-time, and data-driven, BI systems are evolving to support on-line, operational decision-making. In this talk, we describe the challenges in designing and optimizing this next generation of ?Live BI? systems. Many of the challenges stem from the need to scale to enormous data volumes (the ?big data? challenge), the need to integrate a variety of new data types (semi-structured and unstructured data, live streaming data from sensors and social media channels) into the pipeline, the need to enable near real-time decision making, and the need to trade off various quality objectives such as cost, latency, and fault tolerance. In the modern BI architecture, the back-end data integration flows and the front-end query, reporting, analytics, and visualization operations are fused into a single analytics pipeline, where analysis may occur at any stage in the flow. Instead of a “one size fits all” engine, there may be many choices of engine to execute different parts of the pipeline: column and row store DBMSs, map-reduce engines, stream processing engines, and analytics engines. We discuss promising approaches we are taking to meet these challenges.",
