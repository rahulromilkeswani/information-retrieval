    "text": [
        "Professor Daniela Tuninetti received her PhD in telecommunications engineering in 2002 from Télécom ParisTech in Paris, France (formerly École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications), for her work carried out at the Communications Systems Department at EURECOM in Sophia Antipolis, France. She received her MS degrees in electronics and telecommunications engineering in 1998 from Politecnico di Torino in Turin, Italy. From 2002 to 2004 she worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland. She joined the UIC Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2005.",
        "Dr. Tuninetti’s research activities focus on network information theory, which deals with the fundamental limits on information flow in networks and optimal coding techniques and protocols that achieve these limits. A major thrust of her recent research is on cache-aided networks; distributed coded computing; coded data shuffling; pliable, decentralized and secure index coding; and low-latency high-reliability communications. Her research also has explored the theoretical foundations of wireless communication (cooperative and cognitive interference networks, asynchronous massive access IoT systems, and optimal design of coexisting digital communication systems and sensing radar systems) and practical implementation of an on-demand closed-loop feedback-controlled Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS) for patients with pathological tremor (i.e., Parkinson’s Disease and Essential Tremor).",
        "Dr. Tuninetti is a senior member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). She has served in editorial roles for IEEE Transactions on Transactions on Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Communications Letters, IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter, and Elsevier’s Computer Communications Journal. She was a member of the organizing and program committees of several past IEEE conferences, such as the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW), and IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC).",
        "She is an active member of the IEEE Information Theory Society’s Board of Governors, for which she was previously the treasurer."
