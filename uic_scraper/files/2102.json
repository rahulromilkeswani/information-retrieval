Please be sure to monitor your status within the respective CAS portal. Institutional receipt of CAS records by Admissions will be noted through our application system after the completed CAS application record has been noted as mailed or verified by the service. There will be a delay, however, the program’s review of your application is not affected. Any institutional requirements missing after receipt of the finalized CAS record (such as application fees and foreign academic credentials) will be requested to be submitted/uploaded through the checklist.",
