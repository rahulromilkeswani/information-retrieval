    "text": [
        "The Graduate College offers a number of fellowships and awards, totaling almost $2 million, to graduate students. We also administer or liaise with funding agencies for additional opportunities. In Graduate College parlance, “fellowships” carry a stipend, for one or multiple years, as well as a tuition and partial fee waiver; they are used both to recruit new students and to help current students to complete their studies. “Awards” promote research, provide funds for a unique experience, or highlight achievement.",
        "The majority of the Graduate College’s internal awards and fellowships are reviewed by our elected faculty awards committees, which are split into four disciplinary divisions: Arts and Humanities (AH), Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSS), Engineering, Math, and Physical Sciences (EMPS), and Life Sciences (LS).",
        "Our funding opportunities appear below, first fellowships and then awards. Most are run through the Fellowships Office; however, since submission policies vary, instructions should be read carefully.",
        "Under the direction of Theresa Christenson-Caballero, the Graduate College works with other units on campus as well as in the greater Chicago area to provide guidance, resources, workshops, and programs to support its fellows, both academically and professionally.",
        "The Graduate College offers several fellowships to support University of Illinois at Chicago graduate students. Students do not apply directly for these awards. Instead, academic programs submit nominations. Students who wish to be nominated should contact their director of graduate studies (DGS) for details.",
        "Except where noted, Graduate College fellowships carry a stipend of $25,000 as well as a tuition and partial fee waiver. Recruitment fellowships are multi-year funding packages that include fellowship years as well as an academic program-provided employment period which may be “topped” off up to the value of the fellowship stipend. Retention/completion fellowships are for a single year of stipend along with the waiver.",
        "Acknowledging the lack of diversity in faculty around the country, we wanted to build a program at UIC to recruit and support outstanding underrepresented PhD students, who are interested in pursuing careers as faculty members.Our intent is to support these students with competitive funding packages, skills and professional development opportunities and mentoring in order to ensure their success in graduate school and in their future careers. Nomination by the academic program is required.",
        "The goal of the Access to Excellence Fellowship is to increase the number of students from historically underrepresented groups in graduate education who enter careers as researchers and college faculty. Historically underrepresented groups include: African American, Latinx, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islanders.",
        "Formerly the Abraham Lincoln Fellowship, the Access to Excellence Fellowship (AF) has two rounds of applications: recruitment and retention. Both require a nomination by the academic program.",
        "University Fellowships seek to recruit outstanding students newly admitted to terminal master’s and PhD programs under the auspices of the Graduate College at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Applicants must be nominated by their academic program/department.",
        "The Dean’s Scholar Fellowship is a one-year, non-renewable award presented by the Dean of the Graduate College in recognition of a student’s scholarly achievement. The award is intended to provide the most distinguished, advanced-level graduate students with a period of time dedicated solely to the completion of their programs. The Dean’s Scholar competition is open to (a) doctoral students who have passed the Graduate College-required Preliminary Examination and are well into their dissertation work, and (b) MFA students who have passed their second-semester review. Nominations must come from the program.",
        "Established by the Illinois General Assembly and signed as Public Act 093-0862 on August 4, 2004, the DFI provides fellowships to students pursuing post-baccalaureate degrees as part of the state’s effort to diversify the faculties and professional staffs at Illinois higher education institutions. The Graduate College’s Assistant Dean for Diversity administers this program on behalf of the university.",
        "The Graduate College’s Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) has served over one thousand outstanding underrepresented minority college students over more than three decades. The eight-week, faculty-supervised experience introduces students to academic research, graduate admissions, graduate study, and careers in academia. The SROP Early Admission Graduate Fellowship recruits and supports SROP alumni entering a graduate program at UIC.",
        "The Graduate College’s internal awards foster achievement in research, mentoring, scholarship, etc. and vary in monetary amount.",
        "This autumnal competition rewards the most outstanding doctoral dissertation and master’s thesis in each of the Graduate College’s four divisions.  Each of the awards includes a monetary award ($500 for master’s thesis winners and $1,000 for doctoral dissertation winners). Winners may compete in regional and national competition held by the Midwest Association of Graduate Schools (MAGS) and the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS).",
        "Recently renamed, the Graduate College’s longest-running research support mechanism, the Award for Graduate Research (AGR) is open to all current graduate students, in programs under the auspices of the Graduate College, who seek funding in these three categories: travel, summer stipend, and materials/supplies. Using the same forms, the W.C. and May Preble Deiss Fund for Biomedical Research Award provides funds for research in clinical and basic medical sciences. There are two competitions annually: one in the fall semester and one in the spring semester.",
        "Graduate Mentoring Awards are designed to encourage and award excellence and innovation in all aspects of graduate mentoring. Each year the Graduate College will provide up to four awards of $2,000 each per year.",
        "Increasingly, graduate students are seeking positions outside the traditional tenure-track professoriate. To this end, the Graduate College has greatly enhanced its career and professional development offerings to help graduate students consider new career options and to build translatable skills. In an annual spring competition, the PGIA incentivizes graduate students to independently identify short (3-month) internship opportunities that might lead to employment following graduation. Students in programs with mandatory internships as part of their curriculum are ineligible. Full description and instructions.",
        "Since its inception in 2009, this award has supported multidisciplinary scholarship to expose students to varied research and creative fields. The award mechanism has naturally evolved into a way for students early in their studies to develop new research directions for their PhD dissertations or terminal degree thesis/capstone project and has been used by graduate programs as a way for students to practice writing research proposals. Funding is available for pilot grants (or preliminary research) to help students to develop stronger applications for funding from external sources.",
        "The Graduate College at the University of Illinois has created a new award in order to fund graduate students who are suddenly unfunded for the summer due to the global pandemic.",
        "Inspired by the New Deal and its public work projects as well as by the university’s own mission, the Graduate College has created the Public Service Graduate Internship Award (PSGIA). This paid summer experience allows UIC graduate students to serve in the interest of the public good while obtaining valuable “hands-on” experience, albeit virtually. In addition to service for the public good, students receive virtual experience in academic, administrative, and student service units at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",
        "",
        "The Graduate College offers funds to deserving students to defray expenses associated with travel to present original research or scholarly work. Qualifying presentations must be at a meeting or conference of a nationally or internationally recognized scientific or scholarly society. Awards may be used for transportation, hotel, meals, and/or registration expenses.",
        "The Image of Research is an annual interdisciplinary exhibit competition organized by the Graduate College and University Library to showcase the breadth and diversity of research at UIC. Each year, students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program at UIC are invited to submit an image they created along with a brief précis of how the image relates to the student’s overall research. A multi-disciplinary jury reviews the submissions and awards prizes to 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners and three honorable mentions for still-image submissions, and 1st and 2nd place winners for moving images submissions.",
        "Currently on hiatus, this award co-sponsored by the Honors College, highlights the most outstanding, creative, and hardworking graduate students who mentor undergraduates.",
        "University of Illinois provides a limited reserve of waivers to the UIC Graduate College, which we then award to programs in three ways: allocated per semester, for students who have won individual internal and external fellowships, and for students selected for external training grants by programs.",
        "Graduate students who experience an acute and unexpected short-term hardship are able to apply for an emergency grant. This program is being administered by the Graduate College in accordance with applicable University rules and policies. Funding for the Emergency Grant program comes from the Student-to-Student fee that is assessed to graduate students in Fall and Spring Semesters. The fund itself is limited."
