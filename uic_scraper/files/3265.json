        "I received my Ph.D. from Purdue University in August 2015. I spent the summer and fall of 2012 at Google on datacenter congestion control and load balancing. I worked as a senior design designer at Nvidia between 2004 and 2008 when I designed the memory controller for the first unibody MacBook Air (see this this newspaper clip!). I got my bachelor’s degree from BITS, Pilani (India).",
        "Aside from research and teaching, I enjoy playing tennis and reading books. I live in Chicago with my wife Bhairavi Swaminathan. Bhairavi is a researcher at UIC and her work is in molecular biology and genetics.",
