        "Sometimes, all you need to get through a stressful time are some online resources. Other times, online resources are a helpful addition to other therapeutic services. While visiting our site, please consider taking an anonymous mental health screener, or look at the following resources for stress, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, grief and loss, or tragedy. These are not a replacement for therapy, but we hope they help to point you in the right direction.",
        "Social media and other online resources have no shortage of ideas for how to handle stress in the era of COVID-19. While this is positive in many ways, we are aware that integrating these suggestions can be overwhelming. The Counseling Center staff has compiled the following list of both general ideas for coping, as well as situation-specific suggestions."
