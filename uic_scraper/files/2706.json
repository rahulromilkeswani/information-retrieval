        "The VRUPL will conduct a wide variety of VR related projects, based on student",
        "and faculty interests and available resources. Here are a few of our initial",
        "plans:",
        "Holodeck Project",
        "One of the best ways to learn is through example.  The holodeck is intended",
        "to allow an instructor to create a completely virtual world to make a",
        "demonstration.  The class will network in to the instructor's world and",
        "interact while the teacher guides the students.",
        "Virtual UIC",
        "Explore the UIC Campus and find your way to class if you get lost.  This",
        "includes BSB... No one knows how to work that building!",
        "Virtual Reality Based Laboratory Accidents",
        "Every year hundreds of students and others are injured in laboratory accidents,",
        "in spite of all safety precautions. One reason for this is that people tend to",
        "become forgetful and complacent, and stop observing safe laboratory procedures.",
        "Those who have experienced laboratory accidents, however, will remember",
        "those experiences much longer than any set of written rules. Therefore the",
        "overall goal of this project is to produce a set of VR based accident",
        "simulations, to allow users to experience first-hand the consequences of not",
        "following safe laboratory procedures.",
        "Eight to ten different accident scenarios are planned, each with both an \"obey",
        "the rule\" and a \"disobey the rule\" option. In order to have the greatest",
        "possible impact on the widest possible audience, the modules will be developed",
        "in both web-based ( VRML, Java3D, WorldUp ) formats and binary",
        "executable ( C Programming, WorldToolKit, OpenGL ) formats, and will",
        "be distributed free of charge via the world wide web.",
