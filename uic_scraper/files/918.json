        "Gaming Policy  You are free to play games in the ACM office at any time before 10AM or after 3pm with the follow conditions",
        "Space Policy  The ACM office is a shared resource and thus, we have many people coming in any time during the day. While you are free to use the desks and chairs of the ACM, you may not 'hog' a seat. You must give up your seat to another person that wants to do any of the following:",
        "The ACM has no assigned seats and therefore, you must pick up after yourself when you leave. If you are to leave momentarily, please leave a note so nobody takes your seat. Any personal possessions that are left behind with no note will be unplugged (if applicable) and moved into a reclamation bin. Please remember, ACM holds no liability for your possessions. If a note was left but you are gone for a period longer than 1 hour, your possessions will be moved into the reclamation bin. Exceptions to this rule are granted by the ACM officers and must be signed.  Shared Resource Policy  The ACM office offers a refrigerator, toaster oven, microwave, and computers for students, faculty, staff, and invited guests to use. Please refer to the specific rules for each shared resource:  Refrigerator Policy",
