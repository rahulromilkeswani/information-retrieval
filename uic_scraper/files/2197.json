        "Concerns often arise in romantic relationships. Couples therapy is offered to students whose presenting concerns would best be addressed with both members of that relationship present. It is up to the student(s) what constitutes a couple, and all couples are welcome to utilize this service as long as one member of the couple is currently enrolled as a UIC student. To make an initial consultation for couples therapy, please call (312) 996-3490 and schedule a time when both members of the relationship can be present.",
        "",
        "Like individual counseling at the Counseling Center, couples counseling is also brief in nature, typically lasting no longer than one semester. If it seems that a couple may benefit from longer-term counseling, your initial consultation counselor may recommend a community resource. Not sure whether to engage in couples vs. individual or group counseling? Your initial consultation counselor can talk with you about which option is right for you."
