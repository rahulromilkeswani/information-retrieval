        "For convenience, most SFAS forms are available for you to download and print on your local printer. SFAS uses imaging software that requires strict print specifications; therefore, have your printer set up as indicated below.  Please be sure you need to complete a form before filling it out and submitting it to SFAS, and make sure you have selected the appropriate aid year's form. It is advisable to write your UIN on every page of documentation you submit and also to print legibly within the appropriate sections of a form.  This ensures that documents can be promptly read and processed.",
        "Please note, due to the COVID-19 crisis, financial aid is only able to accept uploaded documentation (see PDF Upload Guide for assistance) at this time.",

        "2.       Set PAGE SCALING to ‘Fit to Printable Area’",
