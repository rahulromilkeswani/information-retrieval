        "In order to apply for your J-1 visa (and J-2 dependent visas) you will need to do the following:",
        "Canadian citizens only: You do not  need a J-1 visa, but you must present the DS-2019 form, any supporting  documentation, and proof of paying the SEVIS fee to an immigration  officer at the U.S. border or pre-flight inspection station.  In order  to enter the United States, you must have a passport.",
        "You are required to have health insurance (for you and your  dependents) that meets specific requirements.  You must purchase this  insurance before you arrive in the U.S.  Failure to provide proof of insurance will result in the loss of the J-1’s immigration status and termination in the Exchange Visitor  program.  Please see the enclosed “Medical Insurance Policy Requirements” page for more information.  Some sponsoring departments  may provide stipends to J-1 employees who do not qualify for UIC  insurance, please consult with your department regarding insurance stipends.  For those J-1 individuals funded by UIC that meet the IRS Substantial Presence Test and are classified as Resident Aliens for tax purposes, UIC may provide UIC health insurance benefits.  For more information regarding Payroll and Benefits, please see the Payroll and Benefits website.  Please note that UIC health insurance does not cover all of the requiremetns of J-1 Exchange Visitor program, thus all J-1s with UIC health insurance must purchase supplemental coverage that provides for medical evacuation and repatriation of remains.",
        "",
        "If you purchase insurance in your home country, it must fulfill the  stated requirements and be endorsed by the home country’s government.   If the policy/card is not in English, we will need an English  translation of: company name, policy number, start and end dates.",
        "We have also included a list of possible insurance companies in your J-1 Welcome Packet.",
        "The “Life in Chicago” section of the OIS website has a variety of  information to help you prepare for your arrival in Chicago.   Information includes: climate, currency, public transportation, housing,  and other topics.  You may also want to visit the main UIC website’s  “Living” and “Visiting” links at www.uic.edu.",
        "Please note: The DS-2019 you have received from UIC is valid for participation at the specific UIC department you have indicated, only.   You may not enter the U.S. with UIC’s DS-2019 and decide to  “immediately transfer” to another institution.  Transfers may be  possible later in your stay, but you must first check-in with OIS.",

        "arrival in the U.S. through the SEVIS database within 30 days of your start",
        "date. SEVIS is our mechanism for confirming your arrival to the U.S. and",
        "reporting that information to the appropriate government agencies.  If you",
        "arrive in the U.S., but fail to report to OIS within 30 days of your start date",
        "or fail to provide proof of insurance, your participation in the J-1 program",
        "will be invalidated, carrying severe consequences.",
        "Before coming to OIS, you should",

        "our office.",

        "convenient for you.  When you come to check-in please bring:",
        "During the check-in process, you",
        "will be invited to one of our monthly EV (Exchange Visitor) Scholar Orientations. New Exchange Visitors are legally required to attend",
        "Orientation.  We will review the benefits",
        "and limitations of your immigration status; travel and visa procedures; and",
        "adjusting to life and customs in the U.S. while highlighting campus and city",
        "resources.",
        "Delayed entry: If your visa is  delayed at the consulate, or if there are other unforeseen occurrences  which will prevent you from reporting to OIS within 30 days of your  start date, you must communicate this with your department as soon as  possible.  The OIS advisor may be able to amend your start date.",
        "",
        "Dependents: A dependent is only a spouse or unmarried child under the age of 21 years.  Dependents are considered “J-2s.”  It is possible to have your dependent join you in the U.S.  at a later time.  After your arrival and check-in at OIS, you could  later show documentation that you have adequate funding to support your  J-2 dependents.",
        "Two-year home residency requirement: This potential requirement is explained on Page 2 of your DS-2019.  We will talk about this  regulation in greater detail after you arrive and attend the required  Orientation.",
        "",
        "Social Security Numbers (SSNs): Please  note that according to Social Security Administration regulations, one  is not eligible to apply for an SSN unless he or she is employed by a  U.S. institution.  If UIC is not funding your J-1 program, you will not  be eligible to apply for an SSN.  We will discuss SSNs, driver’s  licenses, and other identification numbers at your Check-in appointment  and at your post-arrival Orientation.  You may also see our website for additional SSN information."
