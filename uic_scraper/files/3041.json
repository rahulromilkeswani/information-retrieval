    "text": [
        "UIC’s Master of Energy Engineering (MEE) students continue their winning ways. Students Hardik Miyani, Lisa White and Zaki Mafraji were recently named winners of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Illinois Chapter 2018 Scholarships.",
        "Miyani and White were awarded $1,500, and Mafraji received $750. The students were three of only five people to receive the scholarships. UIC students have been awarded scholarships every year since 2011.",
        "The scholarships are geared toward encouraging undergraduates to pursue studies in engineering, science or mathematics that would be fundamental for a career in the heating, ventilating, refrigeration and air conditioning field. The scholarships are awards each year and based on academic merit, stewardship and student participation in ASHRAE.",
        "“Winning the Chicago ASHRAE scholarships is an honor for our students,” said William A Ryan, clinical associate professor and director of the MEE program at UIC. “These students are from the Master of Energy Engineering program, which prepares graduates to succeed in the field of building system design, energy efficiency, LEED certification, and sustainability. We are well aligned with ASHRAE’s goals with one entire course series that focuses on sustainable technology for the built environment.”",
        "The Master of Energy Engineering program in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at UIC is a unique program designed for those interested in the growing energy industry. The curriculum provides a diverse course offering reflecting industry concerns such as energy efficiency, creating buildings that are energy efficient, power generation, the grid, management of engineering projects, HVAC design, renewable energy and other energy issues. All classes are taught in the evening on the UIC campus.",
