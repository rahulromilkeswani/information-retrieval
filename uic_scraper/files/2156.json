    "text": [
        "Civil Engineering, BS ’21 | Durango, Mexico",
        "Favorite course: So far, I’d say ME 212 Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics.",
        "Favorite thing about the department you’re majoring in: Professors who care about your learning experience like Joe Schulenberg and Michael McNallan.",
        "Student organizations you’ve joined: American Society of Civil Engineers.",
        "Place you’re most likely to be found on campus: Any place that allows silent study, like the reading area at the library or a few of the lounges in the SELE building, as this is the way I can focus on what I’m doing.",
        "Would you recommend the College of Engineering to new applicants? Absolutely, because there is no need to go out of state in the search of knowledge when you can obtain it locally, in the heart of the city, from a school that cares about its students.",
        "Civil Engineering, BS ’21 | Chicago, IL",
        "Name one thing you think UIC does better than anywhere else: Being a research university allows for students to be actively involved in their respective fields through undergraduate research. Such experience allows for great insight.",
