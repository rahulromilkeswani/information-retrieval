        "Current UIC affiliates (students, faculty and staff) can access University Library resources from remote computers, either by using a Proxy URL or a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Either solution will allow authentication for articles in PubMed, Google Scholar and JSTOR, as well as for other Library-subscribed databases and journals.",
        "Alumni and unaffiliated users cannot remotely access library electronic resources. Please visit the University Library in person for access.",
        "A proxy URL routes your Library-specific traffic through another server, a “proxy server”, which handles your login details for you.  The University Library uses a system called “EZProxy.”",
        "For example, when you use the Library’s proxy URL:  https://proxy.cc.uic.edu/login?url=https://library.uic.edu, you are not directly accessing the Library website,  https://library.uic.edu, but are instead accessing it through the proxy server:  https://proxy.cc.uic.edu.",
        "Browser extensions are 3rd-party software plugins you can install within your web browser to add features, like to automate the use of Proxy URLs.  You must install a separate extension for any browser you use. Our recommendations:",
        "Extensions for other desktop browsers are unknown.  For mobile phones or tablets, first download the mobile version of Chrome (iOS, Android) or Firefox (iOS, Android), and install from there.  Safari on iOS may not be possible.",
        "Once you install your browser extension, you will need to configure it; both recommended extensions include the UIC proxy as an option. Consult the documentation for your particular extension.",
        "Please note that the University Library cannot provide support for these extensions. Your mileage may vary.",
        "For general access to UIC resources, we recommend setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN), provided by UIC’s Academic Computing and Communications Center (ACCC). Using the VPN is like being on campus. It’s equivalent to plugging your computer directly into an outlet, providing you with a UIC IP address. After downloading and installing the VPN, as detailed on the ACCC website, and clicking “Connect”, select the “Library-Resources” Group (not the default “General-Use” group):",
        "Using the “Library-Resources” Group will provide you with access to Library electronic resources, like full-text articles from Google Scholar, JSTOR or PubMed, as if you were on campus.  Restricted-access materials will prompt you to login through the EZProxy system.",
        "Please note, however, that the two “Groups” can be mutually exclusive.  Using the “Library-Resources” Group may impede use of other resources from other UIC departments, such as a file sharing system.  In this case, you may have to logout of the VPN and then log back in using the “General-Use” Group.",
        "The University Library formerly provided a “bookmarklet,” a simple program that modified URLs for some services to use our proxy. The bookmarklet became difficult to maintain and was discontinued in early 2018.",
